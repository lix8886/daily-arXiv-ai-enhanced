We consider a diverse set of chatbot manipulation contexts, from\nconsumer and personal advice to citizen advice and controversial proposition\nargumentation.

Second, even when only instructed to\nbe ``persuasive'' without explicit manipulation prompts, LLMs frequently\ndefault to controversial manipulative strategies, particularly gaslighting and\nfear enhancement. Third, small fine-tuned open source models, such as\nBERT+BiLSTM have a performance comparable to zero-shot classification with\nlarger models like Gemini 2.5 pro in detecting manipulation, but are not yet\nreliable for real-world oversight.
