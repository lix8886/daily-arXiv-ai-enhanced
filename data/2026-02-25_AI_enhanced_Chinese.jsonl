We propose SA-SFT, a lightweight self-augmentation routine in which an LLM generates self-dialogues prior to fine-tuning, and the resulting self-authored data are mixed with task data without modifying optimization or training schedules.\n  Despite requiring no external data or additional tuning, SA-SFT consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting while improving in-domain performance. Across 50 evaluation scenarios, it maintains performance comparable to the original model and achieves the best results in 40 cases, outperforming common baselines such as layer freezing and external data mixing. Guided by these empirical findings, we further present a theoretical analysis suggesting that forgetting can partly stem from style-induced parameter drift, and that self-alignment through self-generated data provides an effective means to counteract this effect. Overall, our results indicate that self-augmentation offers a simple and effective mechanism for robust LLM adaptation without incurring catastrophic forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "SA-SFT是一种不需要外部数据或额外调整的轻量级自我增强方法，它通过生成任务数据前的自我对话数据来缓解灾难性遗忘并提高领域内性能。", "motivation": "面临的挑战是，当对大型语言模型（LLMs）进行窄化和任务特定数据的微调时，灾难性遗忘成为一个重大的挑战，这通常会损害它们的通用知识和推理能力。", "method": "我们提出了SA-SFT，一种轻量级的自我增强流程。在这个过程中，LLM在微调之前生成自我对话语料，然后将这些自动生成的数据与任务数据混合，而不需要修改优化或训练计划。", "result": "在50种评估场景中，SA-SFT在40种情况下取得了最佳结果，超过了常见的基准方法，如层冻结和外部数据混合，且保持了与原始模型相当的性能。", "conclusion": "总的来说，我们的结果表明，自我增强提供了一种简单且有效的方法，可以实现大型语言模型的稳健适应，而不会导致灾难性遗忘。"}}

A common strategy is to train a reflection model as a filter to intercept false alerts with labelled data collected from user verification feedback. However, a key challenge is the noisy nature of such data as it is often collected in production environments. As cleaning noise via manual annotation incurs high costs, this paper proposes a novel method ConceptRM for constructing a high-quality corpus to train a reflection model capable of effectively intercepting false alerts. With only a small amount of expert annotations as anchors, ConceptRM creates perturbed datasets with varying noise ratios and utilizes co-teaching to train multiple distinct models for collaborative learning. By analyzing the consensus decisions of these models, it effectively identifies reliable negative samples from a noisy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptRM significantly enhances the interception of false alerts with minimal annotation cost, outperforming several state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 53.31% on in-domain datasets and 41.67% on out-of-domain datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了一种名为ConceptRM的方法，旨在解决智能代理生成的大量警报（大多数是错误的）导致的疲劳问题。与现有方法相比，ConceptRM在最小化手动标注成本的同时，提高了拦截错误警报的准确性。", "motivation": "由于噪声数据的清理成本高昂，因此本研究旨在开发一种新的方法，以在最小的标注成本下改善虚假警报的拦截。", "method": "ConceptRM 提出了一种新的方法，通过少量专家标注作为锚点，创建具有不同噪声比的扰动数据集，并利用协同教学训练多个不同的模型进行协作学习。通过分析这些模型的共识决策，有效识别来自噪声数据集中的可靠负样本。", "result": "实验结果表明，与几个最先进的LLM基线相比，ConceptRM在领域内数据集上最多可提高53.31%，在领域外数据集上最多可提高41.67%的拦截效果。", "conclusion": "总体而言，ConceptRM通过处理噪声数据集且只需少量标注，显著提高拦截虚假警报的效果。"}}

Existing evaluation approaches rely on demographic surveys, personality questionnaires, or short AI-led interviews as proxies, but lack direct assessment against what individuals actually said. We address this gap with an interview-grounded evaluation framework for personality simulation at a large scale. We extract over 671,000 question-answer pairs from 23,000 verified interview transcripts across 1,000 public personalities, each with an average of 11.5 hours of interview content. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework with four complementary metrics measuring content similarity, factual consistency, personality alignment, and factual knowledge retention. Through systematic comparison, we demonstrate that methods grounded in real interview data substantially outperform those relying solely on biographical profiles or the model's parametric knowledge. We further reveal a trade-off in how interview data is best utilized: retrieval-augmented methods excel at capturing personality style and response quality, while chronological-based methods better preserve factual consistency and knowledge retention.

AI has been validated as a clinical decision aid in providing accurate, rapid real-time analysis of echocardiographic images. Building on this, we propose an AI-enabled framework that leverages intracardiac echocardiography (ICE), a routine part of electrophysiology procedures, to guide clinicians toward areas of arrhythmogenesis and potentially reduce procedural time. Arrhythmia source localization is formulated as a three-class classification task, distinguishing normal sinus rhythm, left-sided, and right-sided arrhythmias, based on ICE video data. We developed a 3D Convolutional Neural Network trained to discriminate among the three aforementioned classes. In ten-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean accuracy of 66.2% when evaluated on four previously unseen patients (substantially outperforming the 33.3% random baseline). These results demonstrate the feasibility and clinical promise of using ICE videos combined with deep learning for automated arrhythmia localization.

Drawing on classical linguistics, we argue that a query's form can also shape a listener's (and model's) response. We operationalize this insight by constructing a 22-dimension query feature vector covering clause complexity, lexical rarity, and anaphora, negation, answerability, and intention grounding, all known to affect human comprehension. Using 369,837 real-world queries, we ask: Are there certain types of queries that make hallucination more likely? A large-scale analysis reveals a consistent \"risk landscape\": certain features such as deep clause nesting and underspecification align with higher hallucination propensity. In contrast, clear intention grounding and answerability align with lower hallucination rates. Others, including domain specificity, show mixed, dataset- and model-dependent effects.
