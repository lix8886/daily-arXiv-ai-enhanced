Moreover, due to the unique perspective of\nUAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to\naccurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.\nTo address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in\nadverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment\nTeacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design\ncalled Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which\ndynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating\ntraining progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the\nlearning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for\nlearning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a\nunique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which\nstatistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically\nadjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This\nstrategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid\nlabels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object\ndetection under adverse scene conditions.

Using the\nopen-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans\npredictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383\nreasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general\ncapability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their\nincorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to\nincrease ($\\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation\nbetween model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift\nin error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.\nThese findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models\nnaturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence\ntoward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and\nlimitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language\nmodel reasoning."}

Despite its\nnumerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still\nfaces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences\nbeyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention\nmechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,\nwhich offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of\nlong-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their\ninherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural\nfoundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.\nAvey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which\ncollaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for\nany given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence.

First,\nit extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the\nsingle-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.\nThis improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model\nrepresentation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image\nReconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features\nobtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.\nThis module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information\ninteraction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for\ndownstream tasks.

Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow\nstrategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion\ndisplacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,\nthe first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative\ncontent-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in\nconventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal\ninteractions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the\nContent-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs\nintra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and\ngenerates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.\nBuilding upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local\nsimilar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along\nthe learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,\nthe Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window\nself-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling\nhigh-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive\nexperiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the\nTransformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer\nparameters."}

Model quantization, particularly to low\nbit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods\nexhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,\nwhile QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational\ncosts, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and\nlacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel\nframework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is\nfounded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation\nquantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization\n``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential\n``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32\nwhile quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to\nkeep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2\nquantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than\nexisting QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32\ntraining, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with\nFP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse\ndownstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object\ndetection.

In\nan ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would\nexpect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers\nto correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to\nincorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For\neach problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator\nwith access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,\nafter which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse\nrange of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific\nreasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language\nmodels including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,\neven under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show\nresistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To\nmitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like\nprogressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously\nattempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help\nmodels achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of\npotential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model\noverconfidence and data familiarity.
