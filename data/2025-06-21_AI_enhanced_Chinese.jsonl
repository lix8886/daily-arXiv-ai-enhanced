Existing methods typically focus on\n1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas\npractical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under\nweak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient\nsemi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,\nwhich leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific\nFreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a\nlightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively\nleveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the\nproposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural\nconsistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient\ntuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution\nremote sensing segmentation approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出了针对0.3米空间分辨率遥感图像的参数高效的半监督分割框架，通过引入特定于遥感的FreqWeaver适配器，提高了结构一致性和分割准确度。", "motivation": "为了处理超高的空间分辨率土地覆盖分类问题，目标是解决高分辨率图像分类成本高昂、尺度变化显著以及大型视觉模型适应性较差的问题。不同于现有的方法主要集中在1米分辨率的图像上并依赖大量标记数据，实际应用中往往需要处理更高分辨率的图像并采用弱监督学习。", "method": "本文提出了一种参数高效的半监督分割框架，用于处理0.3米空间分辨率的遥感图像。该框架利用SAM2的知识，并引入了特定于遥感的FreqWeaver适配器，以增强细粒度细节建模，同时保持轻量级设计，总模型参数仅占5.96%。", "result": "通过有效利用未标记数据并保持极小的参数开销，所提出的方法能够获得鲁棒的分割结果，并且在结构一致性方面取得了1.78%的改进，相比于状态-of-the-art的高分辨率遥感分割方法则有3.44%的优势。", "conclusion": "此方法通过适应更高分辨率图像的半监督分割方式，展现了强大的分割性能和更好的结构一致性，不仅提高了参数效率，还超越了现有方法。"}}
