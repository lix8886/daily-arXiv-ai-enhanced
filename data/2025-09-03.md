### [1] [MultiStream-LLM: Bridging Modalities for Robust Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00030)
*Marshall Thomas,Edward Fish,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CL

> MultiStream-LLM, a modular framework, outperforms monolithic models in sign language translation by addressing the issues of high-speed fingerspelling and facial cues, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the failures of monolithic end-to-end models in recognizing high-speed fingerspelling and integrating asynchronous non-manual face cues in natural sign language.

**Method:** MultiStream-LLM, a modular framework with separate predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and lipreading, which are then fused by a lightweight transformer before passing to a Large Language Model for sentence generation.

**Result:** Achieved a new state-of-the-art on How2Sign benchmark with a BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and 73.2% letter accuracy on the ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset.

**Conclusion:** The multi-expert approach in MultiStream-LLM validates the hypothesis of isolating and solving distinct recognition tasks before fusion for robust sign language translation.

**Abstract:** Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic
end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural
signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the
integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in
Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped
this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously
resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information
such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a
modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs
separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and
lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a
sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight
transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined
representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.
Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a
BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging
ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core
hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion,
our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to
robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

*Teo Susnjak*

Main category: cs.CL

> 该研究提出了一种全新的基于语言模型的系统性文献回顾自动化方法，使用声明式提示优化技术提高可靠性和可重复性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前的方法常常依赖于脆弱且手工制作的提示，这影响了系统性文献回顾的可靠性和可重复性，从而削弱了科学界对语言模型辅助证据综合的信心。

**Method:** 适应最近在通用语言模型应用中发展的声明式提示优化技术，该研究提出了一种将任务声明、测试套件和自动提示调整嵌入可重复的系统性文献回顾工作流程的结构化领域特定框架。

**Result:** 此研究提供了具体的蓝图和代码示例，使研究人员能够构建符合证据综合透明度和严谨性原则的可验证的语言模型流程。

**Conclusion:** 这项工作证明了声明式提示优化技术在系统性文献回顾自动化的适用性，并提出了一种新颖的方法应用于SLR管线中。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate
systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on
brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and
reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in
LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances
in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM
applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR
automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that
embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a
reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a
concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to
construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of
transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of
such approaches to SLR pipelines.

*Jian Wu,Sarah Rajtmajer*

Main category: cs.CL

> 论文分析了自然语言理解(NLU)不同文献中的假设定义差异，强调了清晰定义假设在机器可理解学术记录中的重要性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 随着自然语言处理的进展，针对自动假设提取、理解、测试和生成的研究越来越多。然而，对于“假设”的解释在不同的学科和NLU任务中有所差异。

**Method:** 本论文通过梳理和分析自然语言理解(NLU)领域中不同文献对假设的定义，着重于区分近年来NLU任务中定义的区别。

**Result:** 论文概述并区分了不同定义的假设，并强调了明确定义假设的重要性，特别是在机器可解释学术记录中的重要性。

**Conclusion:** 强调了构建和明确假设的重要作用，这对于我们迈向一个机器可解释的学术记录来说尤为重要。

**Abstract:** Over the past decades, alongside advancements in natural language processing,
significant attention has been paid to training models to automatically
extract, understand, test, and generate hypotheses in open and scientific
domains. However, interpretations of the term \emph{hypothesis} for various
natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have migrated from traditional
definitions in the natural, social, and formal sciences. Even within NLU, we
observe differences defining hypotheses across literature. In this paper, we
overview and delineate various definitions of hypothesis. Especially, we
discern the nuances of definitions across recently published NLU tasks. We
highlight the importance of well-structured and well-defined hypotheses,
particularly as we move toward a machine-interpretable scholarly record.

*Sheldon Yu,Yuxin Xiong,Junda Wu,Xintong Li,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Ritwik Sinha,Jingbo Shang,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种基于状态的转换框架，用来捕捉和抽象链式思维过程中的语义变化，并将其表示为马尔可夫链，以便更好地理解和分析语言模型的推理过程。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管链式思维提示技术使大型语言模型能够进行多步骤推理，但推理过程的可解释性依然不足，特别是在高层次语义角色及其转换方面的探索较为有限。

**Method:** 文章通过谱分析捕捉每个推理步骤中词汇级别的嵌入，并将它们聚类以形成语义连贯的潜在状态。推理过程被建模为马尔可夫链，从而可以揭示推理过程的结构化且可解释的视图。

**Result:** 该方法支持了各种分析，比如语义角色识别、时间模式可视化及一致性的评估。

**Conclusion:** 这种方法为理解和分析语言模型的推理过程提供了结构化且可解释的视角。

**Abstract:** Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large
language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the
explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily
focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic
roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT
trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the
evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via
spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically
coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we
model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and
interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range
of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern
visualization, and consistency evaluation.

### [5] [The Rarity Blind Spot: A Framework for Evaluating Statistical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00245)
*Seiji Maekawa,Hayate Iso,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究引入了独特特征挖掘（DFM）任务和评估框架DiFBench，针对大语言模型全局独特特征识别能力进行了评估。结果揭示模型在执行精细统计推理方面的核心局限性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的大语言模型评估基准强调信息检索或摘要，但不评估模型识别全局独特特征的能力。这项研究的目标是填补这一空白，通过独特的特征挖掘任务更好地了解模型的表现。

**Method:** 引入了独特的特征挖掘（DFM）任务，该任务要求模型分析小到中等规模的文档集合（10-40份文档），并识别出在整个集合中罕见的特征（如在少于10%的文档中出现）。为系统评估这种能力，提出了DiFBench，这是一个可以配置的基准创建框架，具有可控参数如文档集大小与独特性阈值。

**Result:** 对10个先进大语言模型进行大规模评估，结果显示，通用模型与增强推理模型之间存在显著性能差距。随着任务难度和文档数量的增加，所有模型的表现显著下降，并且普遍存在识别错误，即误将频繁特征识别为独特的特征。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现揭示了当前大语言模型在执行精细统计推理和稀有特征检测方面的能力的局限性。

**Abstract:** Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each
candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving
or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a
model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of
documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that
challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and
surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less
than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as
candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning,
not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we
present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable
parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using
DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining
across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance
gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however,
substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We
also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as
distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs'
abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

### [6] [The Differential Meaning of Models: A Framework for Analyzing the Structural Consequences of Semantic Modeling Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00248)
*Zachary K. Stine,James E. Deitrick*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种基于皮尔士符号理论的框架，用于描述复杂的符号建模实践，并讨论了模型语义学。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于该领域缺乏一种普遍的理论框架来跨不同类型模型进行描述，所以本文旨在提供这样一个框架。

**Method:** 本文提出了一个基于C.S.皮尔士的符号理论框架，用于描述不同类型的建模实践。

**Result:** 通过比较不同模型的解释视角，提出了模型语义学的概念，模型被视为符号。

**Conclusion:** 该框架提供了理解和比较符号建模的新视角，并提出了未来研究方向。

**Abstract:** The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes
a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems.
However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these
modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In
this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C.
S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which
can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies
underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a
model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of
performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the
particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast
with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which
models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated
as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical
use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future
directions enabled by the framework.

### [7] [The Temporal Game: A New Perspective on Temporal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00250)
*Hugo Sousa,Ricardo Campos,Alípio Jorge*

Main category: cs.CL

> The paper introduces the Temporal Game, an innovative game-based approach to temporal relation extraction that allows for more fine-grained and flexible annotation than previous methods. The demo version available to the public includes game and annotation modes and supports reinforcement learning agent training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation of this paper is to develop a more efficient and flexible method for temporal relation extraction, which can also support the training of reinforcement learning agents.

**Method:** In this paper, the Temporal Game is proposed as a new method for extracting temporal relations. It transforms the task into an interactive game, making the annotation process more detailed and flexible by focusing on point-based comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities, rather than direct interval-level annotations. This approach supports both interval and instant entities and can help in training reinforcement learning agents by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.

**Result:** The results include a demo that showcases the Temporal Game's potential, featuring a Game mode for annotating texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receiving feedback and an Annotation mode for custom documents, which enables annotations and exporting a timeline.

**Conclusion:** The Temporal Game is presented as both a research tool and an annotation interface, with public availability and open-source code to encourage further research and development in temporal reasoning and annotation.

**Abstract:** In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal
relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of
directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into
point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities.
At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies
temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This
point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities,
enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach.
The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning
agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.
To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game
mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive
feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom
documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore,
this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo
is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code
is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in
temporal reasoning and annotation.

### [8] [Exploring Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding with Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00276)
*Yuxiang Liu,Tian Wang,Gourab Kundu,Tianyu Cao,Guang Cheng,Zhen Ge,Jianshu Chen,Qingjun Cui,Trishul Chilimbi*

Main category: cs.CL

> 论文提出了一种名为Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE) 的方法，该方法能够通过引入生成式大型语言模型的逻辑推理增强文本嵌入，从而提高零样本检索性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管基于Transformer的模型（如BERT和E5）在文本嵌入方面取得了显著的进步，但对于需要复杂推理以检索相关文档的现实世界查询，现有的仅编码器检索器往往表现不佳。该论文旨在通过利用大型语言模型的推理能力来改进这一点。

**Method:** Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE) 方法，利用生成式大语言模型在计算嵌入前生成中间推理文本，增加嵌入的推理深度。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，RITE在BRIGHT推理密集型检索基准上显著提高了零样本检索性能，覆盖了多个领域。

**Conclusion:** 这表明在嵌入过程中加入推理是有效的方法，可以改善检索性能。

**Abstract:** Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text
embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex
real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant
documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers
often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their
strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this
potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual
representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To
bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple
but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text
embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language
model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the
token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with
inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive
retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot
retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of
incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 针对现有方法在处理大量用户评论时要么无法扩展，要么生成通用的一刀切摘要从而忽视个性化需求的问题，我们的研究旨在解决这些问题。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种称为OpinioRAG的可扩展、无训练框架，该框架结合了基于RAG的证据检索与大型语言模型，以高效地生成定制化的摘要。此外，我们还提出了新的无参考验证指标，专门用于情感丰富的领域，这些指标提供了一种细致的、上下文敏感的事实一致性评估方法。

**Result:** 我们贡献了第一个大型长篇用户评论数据集，其中包括每个实体超过一千条评论，以及无偏的专家摘要和手动注释的查询。通过广泛的实验，我们识别出了关键挑战，并提供了改进系统的可行见解。

**Conclusion:** 我们的研究为生成准确、相关和结构化的摘要提供了坚实的基础，并为未来的研究指明了方向。OpinioRAG被定位为一种强大的框架，能够在大规模情况下生成高质量的摘要。

**Abstract:** We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of
user reviews, often exceeding thousands per entity, where existing methods
either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that
overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a
scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval
with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose
novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains,
where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These
metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual
consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale
dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand
reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated
queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide
actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research,
and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant,
and structured summaries at scale.

> 本研究提出了一种基于LLMs构建的工资情绪指数（WSI），旨在预测日本的工资动态，并展示了其在经济政策设计中的巨大潜力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 随着生成式人工智能的出现，本研究旨在探索其在经济文本分析中的新机会，特别是在工资动态预测方面。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）构建的工资情绪指数（WSI），用于预测日本的工资动态。该分析基于日本内阁办公室每月进行的《经济观察者调查》（EWS），该调查收集了对商业条件敏感行业工人实时经济评估的数据。WSI沿用了先前研究中用于价格情绪指数（PSI）的框架，并将其适应于工资相关的情绪。为了确保可扩展性和适应性，还开发了一种数据架构，使其能够集成如报纸和社交媒体等其他数据源。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，基于LLMs的WSI模型在预测性能上显著优于基线方法和预训练模型。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现突显了LLM驱动的情绪指数在提高政府和中央银行经济政策设计的及时性和有效性方面具有巨大潜力。

**Abstract:** The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new
opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment
Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage
dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS),
a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures
real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to
business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index
(PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related
sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also
developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and
social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs
significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the
timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and
central banks.

> 本研究通过提出平衡演员初始化（BAI）方法解决了在应用RLHF到蒸馏训练模型时所面临的序列崩溃和奖励不稳定的问题，实现了训练稳定性与推理能力的优化。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究旨在解决在应用RLHF到蒸馏训练模型的第三范式中出现的两个关键现象：序列长度崩溃（Language Generation在早期RLHF训练中显著减少）和奖励曲棍球棒现象（严重的奖励评分下降随后逐渐恢复），这些不稳定现象从根本上破坏了模型的对齐和推理能力。

**Method:** 本研究提出了平衡演员初始化（BAI）的两阶段加权模型融合方法。首先融合遵循指令的模型和基于蒸馏的推理微调模型，然后将中间模型与预训练模型进一步结合，以保留基本知识。

**Result:** 通过广泛的实验和训练实验的详细分析，证明BAI解决了序列长度崩溃，缓解了奖励曲棍球棒曲线，并实现了连续的序列长度改进。此外，研究还表明平衡的合并比例实现了训练稳定性和推理能力保留之间的最优平衡。

**Conclusion:** 本研究为在第三范式中实现稳定训练提供了有效方案，使得能够融合蒸馏效率与RLHF对齐，训练出更强大的推理模型。

**Abstract:** The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language
models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning
and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove
effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to
distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation
reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length
Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF
training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score
drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally
compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage
weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this
intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational
knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and
detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves
Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables
continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our
analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs
between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work
provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm,
enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency
with RLHF alignment.

> GIER框架通过自我反思和修正来提升语言模型输出，使用自然语言描述推理缺口来改进模型输出，无需降低任务准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 改进语言模型输出质量，特别是推理任务中的推理一致性。

**Method:** GIER使用自然语言描述推理缺口，引导模型自我批评和改进输出。

**Result:** 在三个推理密集型任务中，使用四种语言模型测试，GIER提高了推理质量和一致性。

**Conclusion:** 语言模型能够理解和翻译抽象的推理缺口为具体的推理改进，而不降低任务准确性。

**Abstract:** We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general
framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through
self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike
prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought
templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and
prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better
satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact,
PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and
Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning
alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that
models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them
into concrete reasoning improvements.

*Ziyi Xia,Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

> 提出InfoSeek框架，用于合成复杂的深研任务，该框架可以生成大量的训练样本，并且在评估中表现出色。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的基准测试无法捕捉复杂深研任务的难度，而最近的合成数据集往往会引入捷径推理、知识泄漏或缺乏足够的结构深度。

**Method:** 通过双代理系统递归构建研究树，从大规模网页中模糊中间节点成为有效子问题，并将这些树转化为需要遍历完整层次的问题。还支持快速扩展，产生超过50K的训练样本，一个精选的测试集，以及通过拒绝采样生成的推理轨迹。

**Result:** 实验表明，在BrowseComp-Plus挑战性基准测试中，经过InfoSeek优化的3B语言模型超过了更大的32B模型和较轻量级的商业API，性能与更强大的API相当。

**Conclusion:** InfoSeek框架不仅产生了大量的训练数据，还为高级优化策略提供了支持，包括复合奖励设计和路径级探索。代码和数据集可以在提供的仓库中获取。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple
factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions
into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence
from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers
as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are
fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP
formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)
fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often
introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural
depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for
synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to
recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring
intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into
natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also
enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,
and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that
models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a
challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass
much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash),
while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro).
By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels,
InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound
reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and
datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.

### [14] [GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00388)
*Xuelin Li,Xiangqi Jin,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究提出了GraphKV，一种基于图的框架，用于改进大语言模型中的KV缓存管理，通过动态更新token的重要性和相似关系，可以更高效地管理和压缩KV缓存。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的KV缓存淘汰策略依赖于基于注意力得分的静态启发式方法，无法捕捉tokens在推理过程中变化的隐含依赖关系。为了解决这一问题，研究者提出了GraphKV框架。

**Method:** 提出了一种基于图的框架GraphKV来重新定义KV缓存压缩中的token选择。在这个框架中，tokens被建模为具有重要性得分的节点，而边代表它们之间的相似关系。通过衰减信号传播机制，token的重要性得分可以随着信息在网络中传播而动态更新，从而可以自适应地保留最具有上下文重要性的tokens。

**Result:** GraphKV可以无缝集成到现有的KV缓存淘汰方法中，例如SnapKV和PyramidKV，以实现更高效的KV缓存管理。

**Conclusion:** GraphKV能够提高大语言模型处理长文本序列时的性能，通过自适应地保留上下文相关性高的tokens，从而克服了传统KV缓存管理方法在内存限制下的局限性。代码将会在Github上开源。

**Abstract:** Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long
text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often
limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection
based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the
evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this,
we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for
KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance
scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a
decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by
propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the
most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in
existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a
plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

**Motivation:** To systematically evaluate the efficacy of GCG and T-GCG on a variety of LLMs and to provide insights into the scalability limits and overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning tasks.

**Method:** Gradient-based adversarial prompting techniques, specifically GCG and its variant T-GCG, are analyzed for their effectiveness across different sizes of LLMs.

**Result:** The research indicates that attack success rates are inversely proportional to model size due to complex loss landscapes. Prefix-based heuristics overestimate attack effectiveness compared to GPT-4's semantic evaluation. Coding tasks are more susceptible to attack compared to safety-oriented prompts.

**Conclusion:** The study underscores the need for more robust adversarial evaluation methods and the potential of annealing-inspired strategies to improve adversarial search.

**Abstract:** Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient
(GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large
language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG
and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying
scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack
effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and
reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1)
attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing
complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2)
prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness
compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more
realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more
vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself
can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with
T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and
achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under
semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the
scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning
tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for
more robust adversarial evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 在数字时代，随着网络内容和医学研究文献的不断增加，难以区分可靠的医疗信息来源，且传统的搜索工具不能反映不断发展的研究。因此，需要一种新的系统来综合基于证据的医疗问答答案。

**Method:** 介绍了一种名为MedSEBA的交互式AI系统，该系统利用大型语言模型生成基于证据的医疗问答答案，并从PubMed数据库动态检索可信赖的医学研究。答案由关键点和可追溯到各自研究的论点组成。此外，该平台还提供了最相关研究支持或反驳给定医疗声明的范围概述，以及展示了研究共识随时间变化的可视化图。

**Conclusion:** MedSEBA作为一个强大的工具，适用于日常生活中的健康问题和高级研究洞察，证明了其在现代信息处理中的优势和潜力。

**Abstract:** In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical
advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it
has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading
information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year,
making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific
findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not
reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we
introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing
evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large
Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them
in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database
PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced
back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of
the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given
medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved
through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find
the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and
informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health
questions and advanced research insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究目的是验证LLMs的成功是否真实反映了其推理能力，还是仅仅是模式匹配的结果。通过Camlang测试模型能否通过显式元语言演绎学习掌握新语言，从而深入了解模型的推理能力。

**Method:** 通过构建一种名为Camlang的新语言来测试大型语言模型（LLMs），包括语法规则书和双语词典，以模仿成人第二语言学习，这能够帮助明确区分模型在词法语义、形态句法和句子级推理上的错误。

**Result:** 实验结果显示GPT-5在英语中实现98%的精确匹配准确度，但在Camlang中只达到47%，远低于人类87%的表现。人类进一步验证表明，大多数模型的成功是基于表层词法对齐，而GPT-5显示出一定程度的元语言意识，但不如人类系统地掌握语法。

**Conclusion:** Camlang作为一个认知基础评估范式，揭示了当前模型与人类元语言能力之间的根本差距，暴露了LLMs在理解新兴语言上的不足。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many
benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine
reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an
informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through
explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can
reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We
address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits
naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two
explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror
adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup,
and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and
sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are
sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang
tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang,
creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving
questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in
Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most
model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging
metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical
mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation
paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human
metalinguistic competence.

Main category: cs.CL

> GOSU is a semantic unit-centric RAG framework designed to enhance retrieval and generation by addressing the issues of ambiguity, complexity, and increased overhead associated with high-level semantic units.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To tackle the limitations of current graph-based RAG frameworks, especially concerning the processing of high-level semantic units which can lead to ambiguity and inefficiency.

**Method:** GOSU introduces a method that includes global merging of pre-extracted semantic units to handle coreference resolution more effectively and employs hierarchical keyword extraction alongside semantic unit completion for a balanced approach to capturing both binary and n-ary semantic relationships.

**Result:** Evaluation across various tasks shows GOSU outperforms baseline RAG methods regarding generation quality.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that the GOSU framework is effective in improving the performance of RAG systems by providing a better approach to deal with semantic units and their relationships.

**Abstract:** Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich
retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple
entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a
key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is
prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to
the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework
that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture
interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the
graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs
from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing
the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic
objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce
hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former
uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while
the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from
the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms
the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 伊斯兰继承法（Ilm al-Mawarith）要求对继承人进行精确识别和份额计算，这对AI来说是一个挑战。本文旨在探讨在有限资源下实现此任务的有效方法。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种轻量级框架，用于解决多选继承问题。该框架使用专门的阿拉伯语文本编码器和注意力关联评分（ARS）系统来根据语义相关性对答案选项进行排序，实现了无需生成推理的快速、设备端推理。

**Result:** 作者评估了几种阿拉伯语编码器（MARBERT、ArabicBERT、AraBERT）和基于API的LLM（Gemini、DeepSeek）在QIAS 2025数据集上的表现。结果表明，大型模型的准确率可达到87.6%，但需要更多资源且依赖于上下文。而基于MARBERT的方法准确率为69.87%，在效率、设备部署和隐私方面具有优势。

**Conclusion:** 尽管本文提出的方法准确率略低于最佳LLM模型，但它证明了在高风险领域，小型专业化系统在效率、设备端部署和隐私保护方面的重要优势。

**Abstract:** Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of
heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper,
we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance
questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance
Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance,
and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate
Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based
LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an
accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent.
Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling
case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower
than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a
critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the
practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

**Motivation:** 不确定性量化对于开放性的语言生成来说仍然是一个关键但被忽视的挑战，尤其在黑箱条件限制下，模型内部信号无法获取的时候。

**Method:** 本研究提出了Token-熵符合性预测（TECP）框架，该框架以令牌级熵为度量标准，作为无日志无参考的不确定性度量，并将该度量整合进分割式符合性预测管道中，以构建具有正式覆盖率保证的预测集。

**Result:** 实证评估表明，TECP在六种大型语言模型和两个基准（CoQA和TriviaQA）上，持续实现可靠的覆盖率和紧凑的预测集合，优于先前基于自我一致性的不确定性量化方法。

**Conclusion:** 本方法为黑箱语言模型环境中的可信生成提供了一个原则性且高效的解决方案。

**Abstract:** Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints
where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce
Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages
token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and
integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct
prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches
that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP
directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of
sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to
ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language
models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP
consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets,
outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a
principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM
settings.

**Motivation:** 研究动机在于解决LLM在角色扮演对话中过度发言和使用工具不当的问题，提高对话的有效性和可靠性。

**Method:** 本文探讨了四种提示方法来解决工具增强型大型语言模型(LLM)作为角色扮演对话代理时出现的问题，包括基本角色提示、人工设计角色提示、自动提示优化和基于规则的角色提示。

**Result:** 基于规则的角色提示方法(RRP)通过角色卡片/场景合同设计和严格的函数调用执行取得了最佳效果，整体评分为0.571，优于零次引用基线的0.519分。

**Conclusion:** 研究发现，与自动提示优化等复杂方法相比，基于规则的角色提示设计能显著提升角色扮演游戏代理的有效性和可靠性。

**Abstract:** This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large
language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track
of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this
setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses
(over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona
(under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making
unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches
to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role
prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role
prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best
performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design
and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of
0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings
demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and
reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate
methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts,
we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

**Motivation:** 评估针对研究查询的长篇回复严重依赖专家标注者，限制了领域应用。本研究利用已有的专业知识，通过调查文章整理知识，提供一个更广泛的评估资源。

**Method:** 提出ResearchQA资源，通过将75个研究领域的调查文章提炼出21,000个查询和160,000个评分条目来评估LLM系统。每个评分条目基于查询来自调查文章的部分，列出特定查询的答案评估标准。

**Result:** 31位博士标注者进行的评估表明，96%的查询满足博士的信息需求，87%的评分条目应在系统回复中得到不少于一句的答复。使用评分条目构建的自动配对裁判可以达成74%的与专家判决的一致性。

**Conclusion:** 多数被评估的系统在涵盖评分条目方面未超过70%，而最高排名的代理系统也仅显示75%的覆盖率。错误分析显示，排名最高的系统几乎完全解决了不足11%的引用标准条目、约48%的限制条目和49%的比较条目。

**Abstract:** Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert
annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can
conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey
articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce
ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles
from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric,
derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer
evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing
limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of
queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be
addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are
able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with
expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18
systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented
system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the
highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that
the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric
items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our
data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

> To reduce redundancy in speech representation learning, a method called entropy-based dynamic aggregation is proposed to compress speech representations, achieving comparable or better performance on ASR, translation, and voice conversion tasks compared to uncompressed sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the redundancies introduced by fine-grained tokenization of speech waveforms, which complicates downstream training and inference, and to achieve a balance between phonetic and semantic information that is sufficient for various tasks.

**Method:** The paper proposes an entropy-based dynamic aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations. It includes pre-training a speech language model via next-token prediction, using predictive entropy to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, and applying a cross-attention module to fuse segment information.

**Result:** Experiments on Automatic Speech Recognition, speech-to-text translation, and voice conversion tasks show that the compressed representations perform as well as, or better than, dense token sequences.

**Conclusion:** The proposed approach demonstrates the effectiveness of entropy-based dynamic aggregation for learning compressed semantic speech representations, which not only reduces redundancy but also maintains or improves performance across multiple speech-related tasks.

**Abstract:** Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing
interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically
encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per
second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per
second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders
efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech
representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,
while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level
resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic
aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.
A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on
large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive
entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed
by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By
adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the
representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text
translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed
representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

**Motivation:** 探讨LLMs在法律语境下应对不同法律角色时总结信息的行为，以及这种行为对于法律系统中不同立场的影响。

**Method:** 基于法律现实主义理论及法律实践的新趋势，采用包含不同法律角色条件的提示语，来评估LLMs生成的摘要。评价框架注重法律事实和推理的包含层面，并考虑摘要对特定角色的倾向性。

**Result:** 研究结果显示，即使有平衡指示，LLMs也倾向于包含倾向于特定角色的观点，表明模型可能针对不同角色展现了选择性信息取舍的行为。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现引发了关于LLMs如何在没有明确角色指示的情况下，通过用户之前的行为或上下文来推测用户角色的担忧，且指出需将角色因素纳入高风险法律环境中LLMs摘要行为的评估。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored
summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this
raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models
strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within
the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in
legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on
different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing
judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact
and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders.
Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models
exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives.
These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as
LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without
explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware
evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

**Motivation:** 随着LLMs的广泛应用，对其安全性和与人类价值观的对齐性的担忧日益增加。先前的研究表明，对狭窄和恶意数据集的微调会导致行为偏离。这项工作的动机是揭示一种更令人担忧的现象：推理引起的偏差。

**Method:** 通过切换到“思考模式”或对良性数学数据集进行微调来增强推理，从而观察LLMs对恶意请求的响应性增加。此外，通过分析内部模型状态，发现注意力偏移和MoE模型中的专业专家有助于将过度推理重新导向到安全护栏上。

**Result:** 注意力偏移和MoE模型中的专业专家有助于缓解过度推理，并向安全指导方针重新定向。这些发现提供了关于推理与安全之间新兴平衡的新视角。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现揭示了推理与安全之间的新平衡，强调了对于先进推理模型增强对齐措施的紧迫性。

**Abstract:** With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted,
concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have
intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and
malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more
concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe
that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is
strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math
datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze
internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized
experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards
safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging
reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment
for advanced reasoning models.

**Method:** 研究中采用线性探测方法对提示进行评分，并用LLM重写策略将提示转向更自然的部署环境，同时保持原始任务不变。

**Conclusion:** 评估意识是一个可量化和可操纵的因素，直接影响LLM的行为，这表明在部署前需要更实际的评估框架来准确测量模型对齐情况。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when
they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled
evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This
discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark
performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In
this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating
the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear
probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like"
and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more
natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using
this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a
strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of
state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that
rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in
behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest
responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses
of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,
indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that
evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly
influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or
deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent
need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model
alignment before deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 标准Transformer架构虽然在序列建模任务中表现突出，但其自注意力机制的计算复杂度呈二次增长，带来了处理长序列时的瓶颈。由于这个原因，研究者开发了Gated Associative Memory网络，旨在通过降低复杂度来有效处理长序列。

**Method:** 本文提出了Gated Associative Memory (GAM)网络，这是一种全新的、完全并行的序列建模架构，其复杂度与序列长度成线性关系（O(N)）。GAM模块用两个并行路径替换了自注意力层：因果卷积，用于高效捕捉局部依赖关系；并行关联记忆检索机制，用于建模全局的内容相关模式。这两条路径通过门控机制动态融合，允许模型灵活地将局部和全局信息结合起来。

**Result:** 实验显示GAM在训练速度上比标准的Transformer模型和现代线性时间基线（Mamba）更快，并在WikiText-2基准和TinyStories数据集上取得了更好的或具有竞争力的最终验证困惑度（perplexity），证明了它作为高效的序列建模替代模型的潜力。

**Conclusion:** GAM作为一种序列建模的替代模型，展示了其在此领域的潜力。这种架构不仅能显著提高训练速度，还在不同数据集上展示出了更好的或相同水平的最终验证困惑度，证明了其有效性和效率。鉴于其实现的简便性和性能上的优势，GAM被认为是未来序列建模的一个亮点。

**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism,
has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core
computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)),
creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper,
we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel
architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with
respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer
with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local,
position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval
mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are
dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly
combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from
scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard
Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2
benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 作为评估语言模型的领域，程序设计竞赛尚未受到足够的关注。本文旨在通过开发和评估语言模型来解决这一领域中的问题，特别是提升它们在复杂编程任务中的表现。

**Method:** 本文提出了ICPC基准测试，它由254个国际大学生程序设计竞赛任务组成，每个问题包含官方解析、参考代码和样本等高质量测试资源，用于开发和评估各种语言模型在程序设计竞赛中的推理技术。

**Result:** 研究发现，在零样本coT提示下，o1模型的通过率仅为19.1%，而结合多轮自我评判和反思等技术后，这一数值提升到42.2%。另外，在有人机交互调查中，o1模型也能通过一些特定指令解决18个问题中的17个。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，通过结合多轮自我评判、反思和记忆检索的方法，语言模型在解决编程问题上的能力可以得到有效提升，特别是对一些之前难以解决的问题。这为语言模型在具备基础、创造性和算法思维方面迈出了重要一步。

**Abstract:** Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming
where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and
the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it
has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC
benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest
(ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and
sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and
evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with
these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1
only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique,
which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over
episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new
human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining
difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems
that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few
specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and
algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative
research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

*Sanjeeevan Selvaganapathy,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究表明，虽然审查的LLM在检测仇恨言论时比未审查的LLM表现更好，但其依赖于安全对齐产生的意识形态一致性可能使得未审查模型更加多样化。所有模型在理解细微语言（如讽刺）方面均存在问题，且对不同目标群体的表现显示出公平性差异。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究动机是探索未审查模型是否提供更为客观的分类能力，因为它理论上不受道德护栏的影响。

**Method:** 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在检测隐性和显性仇恨言论方面的有效性，比较了几乎没有接受安全对齐的模型（未审查）与高度对齐（审查）的模型之间的分类能力差异。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，审查模型在准确性和鲁棒性方面明显优于未审查模型，分别达到了78.7%和64.1%的严格准确率。然而，这种表现提升伴随着安全对齐带来的强烈意识形态锚定，导致审查模型对基于角色的影响具有较强的抵抗力，而非审查模型则更容易受到意识形态框架的影响。

**Conclusion:** 这一发现挑战了LLM作为客观仲裁的角色，并强调了需要更为复杂的审计框架来考虑公平性、校准和意识形态一致性。

**Abstract:** We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting
implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety
alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities
compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored
models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral
guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a
surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored
counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1%
strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own
limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making
censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models
prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify
critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as
irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across
different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders
self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs
as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing
frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 混合专家（MoE）模型因其动态资源分配和在各种任务中的卓越性能而受到广泛关注。但是，训练这些模型仍然是一个挑战。MoE upcycling技术旨在重用和改进现有的模型组件，从而最小化训练开销。然而，简单的路由器，如线性路由器，在MoE upcycling中的复杂路由任务中常常难以胜任。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为Router Upcycling的新路由技术，旨在提升MoE upcycling模型的性能。该方法在upcycling过程中从先前的注意力层中初始化多个路由器，这些路由器以类似注意力的方式协作地分配标记到专门的专家。每个标记被处理成不同的查询并与专家特征对齐（作为键）。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能，超过了其他upcycling基线。

**Conclusion:** 这种方法通过Router Upcycling技术显著提高了MoE upcycling模型在复杂任务中的性能，并且在实验中达到了最新的先进性能。

**Abstract:** The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep
learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance
across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains
challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve
existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this,
simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing
tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique
called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our
approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding
attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens
to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed
into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys).
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究小型语言模型生成伪造文本，特别是新闻标题，说明它们对在线生成虚假文本的潜在能力。

**Method:** 使用受控的提示工程，研究了14个小型语言模型在生成低质量与高质量欺诈性新闻标题时的表现，并测试了这些标题与真实新闻标题的相似度。通过使用DistilBERT和bagging分类器模型对这些标题进行质量检测以评估它们的真实性。

**Result:** 小型语言模型在生成虚假新闻标题时表现出较高的遵从率，只有少数例外情况。应用于生成的虚假新闻标题的质量检测结果显示，质量误分类非常常见，检测准确率在35.2%到63.5%之间。

**Conclusion:** 测试的小型语言模型能够在生成虚假新闻标题时保持较高的遵从性，但存在轻微的伦理限制差异，且生成的新闻标题未能接近现有的主要由人类编写的内容。

**Abstract:** Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may
potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14
SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and
Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news
headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to
real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000
headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive
categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline
quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news
headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical
resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality
detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed
that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only
ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs
generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are
slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not
closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the
low quality classification accuracy.

**Motivation:** 多模态输入的时间序列预测方法往往依赖高质量的文本和时间序列数据，当文本不足以准确反映历史时间序列信息时，预测性能会受到影响，因此需要增强文本内容以提升多模态预测性能。

**Method:** 提出了文本强化模型(TeR)，该模型通过强化学习方法生成质量更高的补充文本，用来增强多模态时间序列预测模型对时间序列的理解，并通过奖励机制优化TeR模型，提升生成文本的质量。

**Result:** 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，改进的多模态时间序列预测方法优于其他基准模型和已有研究。

**Conclusion:** 强化文本模态能有效提升多模态时间序列预测的性能，提出的TeR模型通过奖励机制优化生成文本质量，促进了预测性能的提升。

**Abstract:** Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such
as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These
studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual
information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising
results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series
inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture
the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable
performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the
textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we
propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose
a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses
potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to
support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving
TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced
text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on
the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF
model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as
to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF
performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering
various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which
outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

**Abstract:** Probing with sparse autoencoders is a promising approach for uncovering
interpretable features in large language models (LLMs). However, the lack of
automated evaluation methods has hindered their broader adoption and
development. In this work, we introduce CE-Bench, a novel and lightweight
contrastive evaluation benchmark for sparse autoencoders, built on a curated
dataset of contrastive story pairs. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies
to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that CE-Bench
reliably measures the interpretability of sparse autoencoders and aligns well
with existing benchmarks, all without requiring an external LLM. The official
implementation and evaluation dataset are open-sourced under the MIT License.

> RevBrowse is a review-driven recommendation framework that uses LLMs and a retrieval-augmented module to enhance recommendations by effectively using user reviews.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to effectively incorporate user reviews into recommendation systems to better capture fine-grained user preferences and item attributes, addressing challenges such as limited context windows and difficulty in prioritizing relevant reviews.

**Method:** RevBrowse proposes a review-driven recommendation framework that integrates user reviews into the LLM-based reranking process, and uses PrefRAG to adaptively retrieve preference-relevant content.

**Result:** Experiments on four Amazon review datasets show that RevBrowse consistently outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.

**Conclusion:** RevBrowse not only improves recommendation performance but also provides interpretability by highlighting relevant reviews for decisions.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation
tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge
integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based
recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to
reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively
incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to
(1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained
context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews
most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these
challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework
inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in
online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based
reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate
items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce
PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item
representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves
preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive
experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves
consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its
generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.
Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse
offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews
influence the final recommendation.

> Masked diffusion models的解码方法往往生成顺序类似自回归过程。本文提出了一种新的解码策略Reward-Weighted Sampling，以改善这一现象。实验表明，该策略提高了生成质量和非自回归性质。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究发现标准的MDMs解码方法，比如基于置信度的采样，通常会导致生成顺序类似顺序自回归过程，这限制了非自回归建模的优势。

**Method:** 提出了一种新的解码策略，称为Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS)，该策略在各个扩散步骤中，使用外部奖励模型评估中间序列的质量，并相应调整token的logits，以引导token的选择，从而增加初始得分较低的token的信心，促进更非自回归的生成顺序。

**Result:** 实验表明，RWS显着促进了非自回归生成顺序，并在多个评估指标上得到了改进，这突显了在增强MDMs的非自回归特性和整体性能中，整合全局信号的有效性。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，通过引入外部奖励模型并集成全局序列级别的连贯性信号，可以有效地改进MDMs的非自回归生成过程，并提高其整体性能。

**Abstract:** Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive
alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs,
such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on
individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that
this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling
sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of
non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose
Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an
external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the
iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS
evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token
logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global
sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of
tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more
non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial
rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward.
Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive
generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.
These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in
enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of
MDMs.

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Higher education faces growing challenges in delivering personalized,
scalable, and pedagogically coherent learning experiences. This study
introduces a structured framework for designing an AI-powered Learning
Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to
support adaptive, interactive, and learner-centered instruction. Using a
design-based research (DBR) methodology, the framework unfolds through five
phases: literature review, SWOT analysis, development of ethical-pedagogical
principles, system design, and instructional strategy formulation. The
resulting AI-LMS features modular components -- including configurable prompts,
adaptive feedback loops, and multi-agent conversation flows -- aligned with
pedagogical paradigms such as behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist
learning theories. By combining AI capabilities with human-centered design and
ethical safeguards, this study advances a practical model for AI integration in
education. Future research will validate and refine the system through
real-world implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文研究的动机源于大型语言模型的快速发展，尤其是对于中文这样具有微妙语言差异的语言，这给当前的方法带来了巨大的挑战。准确检测AI生成文本的需求日益增加，尤其是在中文中，语言细微差别使得该问题更加复杂。

**Method:** 本研究系统比较了基于编码器的Transformer模型（如Chinese BERT-large和RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large）、仅解码器的大型语言模型（阿里巴巴的Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B通过低秩适应LoRA进行微调）和FastText基线模型。编码器模型通过一种新的基于提示的掩码语言建模方法进行微调，而Qwen2.5-7B通过指令格式输入和轻量级分类头（使用LoRA训练）进行分类任务的适应。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，在面对分布变化时，虽然编码器模型几乎记住了训练数据，但存在明显的性能下降（RoBERTa: 76.3%测试准确率；BERT: 79.3%）。FastText展示出令人惊讶的词法鲁棒性（83.5%准确率），但缺乏深层次的语义理解。相比之下，通过LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B实现了95.94%的测试准确率，并具备平衡的精度-召回率指标，显示出强大的泛化能力和对数据集特定特征的抵抗能力。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果证明，通过参数高效的微调方法，基于解码器的大型语言模型在中文AI生成文本检测方面表现出色。未来工作将探索下一代Qwen3模型、蒸馏变体以及集成策略，以进一步提高跨领域的鲁棒性。

**Abstract:** The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand
for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like
Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current
methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based
Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM
(Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank
Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset
from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models
were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach,
while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format
input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments
reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer
significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3%
test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical
robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In
contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with
balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and
resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the
efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust
Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation
Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance
cross-domain robustness further.

**Motivation:** 现有的基于问题分解的方法生成的问题往往不相关且不完整，导致检索时事实丢失。同时这些方法也未能从不同的文档和段落中聚合证据片段。FIDES框架旨在解决这些问题。

**Method:** FIDES采用了一种上下文增强的两阶段忠实分解方法，将长篇答案分解为子事实，这些子事实用于检索相关的证据片段。如果检索到的证据片段与相关子事实冲突，则相应地修订这些子事实。最后，根据原始句子聚合证据片段。

**Result:** 在六个数据集上进行了广泛的评估，FIDES在GPT-3.5-turbo，Gemini和Llama70B系列上的平均性能超过现有的SOTA方法超过14%，并且提出了一个新的评估证据准确性的指标$Attr_{auto-P}$。

**Conclusion:** FIDES框架通过改进的子事实分解方法和证据片段的聚合策略，在多个大型语言模型上显著提高了带标注的问答数据集的性能。

**Abstract:** Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models
(LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to
generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated
questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in
retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from
different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new
fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context
enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES
uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to
decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever
to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets
conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised
accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the
original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets,
with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating
the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in
average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的研究通常将司法意见生成分为两个独立子任务：法律推理和量刑预测，这造成了推理与预测之间的不一致，也没有很好地满足实际司法需求。手动构建的知识虽然增加了方法的适用性，但在实际部署中仍有局限性。研究旨在解决这些问题，并更好地贴近法律实践。

**Method:** 研究提出了新的LegalAI任务：司法意见生成，目的是同时生成法律推理和量刑决策。针对这一目标，引入了LegalChainReasoner框架，该框架通过结构化的法律链条来指导模型进行全面的案件评估，整合了事实前提、复合法律条件和量刑结论，确保了灵活的知识注入和端到端的意见生成。

**Result:** 在两个真实的且开源的中文法律案件数据集上，提出的这种方法的表现优于基线模型。

**Conclusion:** 研究提出的方法有效解决了现有司法意见生成任务中推理和预测分离导致的一致性问题，并且通过实验展示了其优于基线模型的性能，这对于支持量刑一致性分析以及法官参考类似过去的案件有着重要意义。

**Abstract:** A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case,
including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such
opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with
references to similar past cases. However, current research typically
approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning
and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between
the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial
requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to
enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment.
To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a
new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces
both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce
LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide
the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual
premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach
ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.
Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

**Result:** 模型在理解概念上的准确率达到了0.8，但在Exact Match（EM）得分上依然显著较低，特别是在测试阶段。为了缓解冗余并提高评估指标的对齐，提出了一种两阶段推理管道来进行精确的短答案提取，尽管有部分改进，但在生成严格格式化输出方面仍存在挑战。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果突显了在生物医学LLM应用中，语义理解和精确答案评估之间的差距，需要进一步研究输出控制和后处理策略。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question
answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their
performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before
deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper
presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task,
which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases,
genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging
LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled
from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental
setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short
answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain
understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their
Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test
phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer
extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics.
Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly
formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic
understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications,
motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决多语言环境中主题模型训练所面临的困难，特别是在缺乏目标语言知识或数据有限的情况下。

**Method:** 介绍了一种新的方法Topic Model Translation (TMT)，它不需要元数据、嵌入式或对齐语料库，能够实现主题模型在不同语言之间的转移。

**Result:** 通过对TMT进行广泛的定量和定性评估，证明它可以生成语义连贯且一致的主题翻译。

**Conclusion:** TMT方法的提出为在缺乏大量语料库或手动翻译不可行的情况下，利用已有主题模型资源提供了可能。

**Abstract:** The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging
task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and
manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the
developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an
environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual
corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a
novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models
(e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language
to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT
enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially
suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are
unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT
extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that
it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

<details>

**Motivation:** 随着基于生成性AI的对话系统的数量日益增多，评估这些系统成为一个重要的挑战。本文旨在通过DSTC-12竞赛来解决这个问题。

**Method:** 本文采用了两种主要策略来评估对话系统：一是通过提示的方式利用语言模型（LMs）作为评估者；二是训练基于编码器的分类和回归模型。

**Result:** 结果表明，虽然LMs的提示方法仅与人类判断有中等程度的相关性，但它在测试集上的排名第二，仅次于基线。参数显著较少的回归和分类模型在验证集上展示了某些维度上的高相关性。尽管这些模型在测试集上的表现有所下降，但测试集包含了一些维度的评分范围显著不同于训练和验证集。

**Conclusion:** 研究发现，在资源有限的情况下，即模型参数少于130亿，通过提示的语言模型评估方法和基于编码器的分类与回归模型能实现较高评价效果，尽管某些维度的性能受测试集评分范围影响有所下降。

**Abstract:** The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their
evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this
important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12,
Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level,
dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small
models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main
strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting,
and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations
with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only
by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly
fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the
validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is
important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly
different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and
validation sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前文本嵌入模型优化过程中使用的负样本主要是随机取样的，往往未能有效增强模型辨别细微语义差异的能力。因此，引入多粒度级别负样本合成框架旨在提升模型的语义鉴别能力，并提出有效池化策略，希望改进文本嵌入性能。

**Method:** 该工作提出Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH)合成框架，利用大语言模型生成多相似度级别的负样本，支持粗细分级学习策略。此外，引入Anchor Token Aware (ATA)池化方法，赋予锚点词更高的权重，来改进文本嵌入的准确性。

**Result:** 本文提出了Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH)合成框架，利用大规模语言模型（LLMs）生成不同相似度级别的多样化负样本，支持对比学习中的粗细分级策略，从而逐步学习更精细的语义表示。同时，提出Anchor Token Aware (ATA)池化方法，提高文本嵌入的准确性而不会增加模型复杂度。在MTEB基准上的实验表明，该方法达到了目前最先进的性能。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明，这两种方法使得文本嵌入模型能在MTEB基准上达到最先进的性能。

**Abstract:** Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing
tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense
vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of
(query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the
negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to
discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels
of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine
curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding
model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile,
we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher
weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs,
improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity.
Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods
achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies
both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

**Motivation:** 研究的动机在于展示文本转图像(TTI) 模型，尽管是强大的创意工具，但也有可能放大有害的社会偏见。因此，通过评估和改进这些模型生成的图像来减少这些偏见是至关重要的。

**Method:** 该研究将对社会代表性偏见的评估定义为一个图像整理和评估任务，并引入了一个关于五个具有社会显著性的职业角色（CEO、护士、软件工程师、教师、运动员）的雏形基准。使用了五个最先进的模型：闭源（DALLE 3，Gemini Imagen 4.0）和开源（FLUX.1-dev，Stable Diffusion XL Turbo，Grok-2 Image）。将中性的基线提示与旨在鼓励人口统计学多样性公平意识的控制提示进行比较。

**Result:** 研究发现，提示可以大幅改变人口统计学的代表，但结果因模型而异：一些系统有效多元化，另一些过度校正以至于产生不现实的均匀性，还有一些则反应不大。

**Conclusion:** 这些结果突出展示了提示作为一种公平性干预手段的潜力和局限，强调了需要采取互补的模型级别的策略来减少偏差。

**Abstract:** Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying
harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an
image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of
occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse,
Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models:
closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable
Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against
fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity.
All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black,
White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that
prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly
model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect
into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These
findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a
fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level
strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型（LLMs）在语言理解方面表现出色，但在对齐欺骗或误导输入时，生成的响应可能偏离事实。本文旨在通过分析阿谀奉承幻觉，提出一种方法来减轻该问题。

**Method:** 通过设计两种范式生成一致的阿谀奉承幻觉的诱因输入，本文提出了一种名为协作对比解码（CCD）的方法来处理LLMs中的阿谀奉承幻觉。通过对比诱因输入和转换后的中性输入之间的输出分布偏差，CCD可以减少对欺骗性或误导性信息的依赖，而无需额外训练。

**Result:** 广泛的实验表明，所提出的CCD能够有效减轻阿谀奉承幻觉，并提高各种任务中生成响应的事实性。

**Conclusion:** 通过协作对比解码技术，可以在不进行额外训练的情况下减少大型语言模型对欺骗性或误导性输入的依赖，从而提高模型响应的准确性和真实性。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in
language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive
and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de
facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where
the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over
accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in
various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive
decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design
two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for
the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the
collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations
across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output
distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD
can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without
requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the
factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

> 研究提出了EviNote-RAG，通过引入检索-笔记-回答的结构化流程解决了传统检索-回答机制存在的检索证据低信噪比和多跳推理错误积累的问题。该方法优于现有强基线模型，提升了问答任务的准确性、鲁棒性和效率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** LLM结合检索机制虽然提升了开放领域问答的能力，但直接从检索到的内容推理会遇到有用信息被无关信息淹没和多跳推理中错误积累的问题。EviNote-RAG旨在通过结构化的工作流解决这些问题，以实现更忠实和稳健的推理，同时减少噪音的影响。

**Method:** EviNote-RAG模型引入了一个结构化的检索-笔记-回答的工作流，该模型首先从检索到的原始结果中，通过生成支持性证据笔记（SEN）来提炼答案相关的有用信息，并高亮不确定性。SENs的生成和质量被证据质量奖（EQR）进一步强化，这是一种基于蕴含的信号，用于评估SENs是否逻辑上支持最终答案。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，EviNote-RAG在内部和外部问答基准测试中，在准确性、泛化能力和训练稳定性方面优于强基线模型。特别是在HotpotQA、Bamboogle和2Wiki上，相对F1值分别提升了20%、40%和91%，增强了模型的鲁棒性和效率。

**Conclusion:** EviNote-RAG模型通过生成支持性证据笔记（SENs）和证据质量奖励（EQR），成功改善了LLM在开放领域问答任务中的表现，显示出在提高准确性、泛化能力和训练稳定性方面的潜力。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have
achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the
conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key
limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful
information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in
multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address
these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that
introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly
reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose
Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only
answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when
no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by
the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates
whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide
the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of
noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that
EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy,
generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves
state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding
relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and
91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

**Motivation:** 讽刺、反讽和讽刺等手法常用于表达幽默和批评，但有时候会被误认为是事实报道，类似于假新闻。这些技巧可以以更精细的层面运用，将讽刺性信息融入新闻文章中。因此，我们创建了这个讽刺句子级别的数据集以应对这一挑战。

**Method:** 我们构建了一个名为SeLeRoSa的罗马尼亚语讽刺句子级别数据集，包含13,873个句子，这些句子涵盖了社会问题、IT、科学和电影等不同领域。我们评估了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的多个基线模型，在零样本和微调设置下进行了测试，并对比了基于Transformer的基线模型。

**Result:** 我们的研究揭示了当前模型在句子级别的讽刺检测任务中的局限性，为未来的研究指明了方向。

**Conclusion:** 我们的研究发现表明，当前模型在句子级别的讽刺检测任务中还存在一些局限性，未来的研究可以通过此数据集进一步探索改进方法。

**Abstract:** Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and
critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for
factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more
granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news
articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for
Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset
comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains,
including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent
progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing
literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various
tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs
in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline
transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these
models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new
research directions.

> This paper presents SIFT, a method combining in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning for sequence labeling tasks with large language models, showing superior performance compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for generative sequence labeling tasks, particularly focusing on supervised in-context fine-tuning.

**Method:** SIFT (Supervised In-Context Fine-Tuning) casts sequence labeling tasks as constrained response generation, combining in-context learning from demonstrations with supervised fine-tuning.

**Result:** SIFT outperforms in-context learning and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on several standard sequence labeling tasks. Long context hinders performance in both in-context learning and SIFT, but omitting instructions mitigates this issue.

**Conclusion:** The response-based generative task formulation through SIFT highlights a feasible approach to sequence labeling with large language models, indicating potential for improved performance over traditional encoder-based models.

**Abstract:** Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are
abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment
analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL
tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows
that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to
become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)
generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid
scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose
own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context
fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained
response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL)
from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably
outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of
standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the
performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be
mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely
unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings
highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the
importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL
performance.

**Motivation:** The goal is to improve the quality of English-to-Spanish medical translation by leveraging domain-specific knowledge to better assist LLMs in handling medical terminologies and contexts.

**Method:** We present MedCOD, a hybrid framework that integrates domain-specific structured knowledge from UMLS and LLM-as-Knowledge-Base paradigm into LLMs to enhance English-to-Spanish medical translation. Four open-source LLMs are evaluated using structured prompts incorporating multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning.

**Result:** MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all evaluated models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved high scores in BLEU, chrF++, and COMET metrics, surpassing baseline models.

**Conclusion:** The integration of structured domain knowledge through structured prompts and fine-tuning enhances the performance of LLMs for medical translation tasks.

**Abstract:** We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed
to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating
domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD
integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance
structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999
English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with
structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B,
Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that
incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived
definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all
models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23,
chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o
and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model
adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their
combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the
potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical
translation tasks.

**Conclusion:** 研究结果为开发透明、可控、适应性强的智能系统提供了新方法，这种系统能够处理未知场景并提高模型的泛化能力。

**Abstract:** The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been
shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the
other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm
leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors
and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm
centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and
model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence,
this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms.
Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both
paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure,
through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization
to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general
knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable
intelligent systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the issue of existing LLMs generating reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability in medical question answering.

**Method:** Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a framework combining reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement to improve clinical chain-of-thought performance.

**Result:** Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, with a 1.1B parameter model outperforming larger models.

**Conclusion:** Combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement is a scalable and effective approach for building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

**Abstract:** Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain
knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models
(LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical
reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a
novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with
preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought
(CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by
employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation
mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while
automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike
traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking
optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence
regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE
show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B
parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including
medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining
preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and
effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

**Conclusion:** 该研究通过词图和不同的排名算法成功展示了计算孟加拉语单词排名的过程，并分析了算法的成效。

**Abstract:** Ranking words is an important way to summarize a text or to retrieve
information. A word graph is a way to represent the words of a sentence or a
text as the vertices of a graph and to show the relationship among the words.
It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the
words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are
calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various
graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word
database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which
has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts
of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking
algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps
are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms
to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire
procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the
construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real
data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型在处理文化特异性沟通规范时存在困难，研究旨在解决这些问题，特别是针对伊朗文化中的taarof现象。

**Method:** 构建了包含450个角色扮演场景的TaarofBench基准以评估五个前沿语言模型的taarof理解能力，进行了有监督微调和直接偏好优化。

**Result:** 结果显示模型在taarof理解上的准确率比土著说话者低40-48%，通过改进方法模型的对齐度提高了21.8%和42.3%。

**Conclusion:** 论文为开发多样且文化感知的大型语言模型奠定基础，此类模型能够更好地处理复杂的社交互动。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific
communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus
on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a
sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty,
and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We
introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of
taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social
interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five
frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy
rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate.
Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language
prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses
rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the
limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning
and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in
model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33
participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers)
forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work
lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling
applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

**Motivation:** To address the gap in research on maintaining stylistic consistency across generated responses in crisis communication, ensuring affected individuals retain trust in responders.

**Method:** Our method employs a two-stage process: it first assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates them at the instance level through a fusion process.

**Result:** Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both response quality and stylistic uniformity.

**Conclusion:** The proposed metric for evaluating style consistency and the fusion-based generation approach provide a novel and effective method for maintaining stylistic consistency in automated crisis communication responses.

**Abstract:** In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明，Controlled-Literacy框架生成的对策言论相比于基线方法更具有可访问性和用户偏好。这项研究通过提高生成的对策言论的可访问性和可理解性，对更公正、更具影响力的公共健康传播做出了贡献。

**Abstract:** Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech

ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of
shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant
performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas
ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect
important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a

**Motivation:** 记录了一种在乌尔都语动词和时态组合可能性上的范式差距：-ya: kar结构的完成形式（如ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv）在现代乌尔都语和印地语中显然是不正确的，尽管在19世纪的文学作品中广泛存在。研究这一历时变化。

**Method:** 通过历时文本分析、大规模语料库研究以及以母语者为对象的主观评估任务，研究了这一历时变化。

**Result:** 调查发现，完美形式在大规模语料库中几乎完全不存在，母语者在主观评估任务中也将这种形式判断为极不自然。

**Conclusion:** 由于构造成分要求主格主语和不变的分词与及物完成体分配施动格这一核心语法规则冲突，导致完成形式不稳定，并逐渐被其他结构替代，成为现代语法中的固定现象。

**Abstract:** In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities
of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction
(e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and
Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate
this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus
study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective
evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly
unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic
conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an
invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive
perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form
unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap
to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

Main category: cs.CL

> This paper introduces DistilledPRAG, a parametric RAG model that ensures document privacy while enhancing cross-document reasoning and maintaining performance levels comparable to standard RAG. DistilledPRAG overcomes the challenges of high inference latency and poor out-of-distribution generalization by aligning with the document structure and parameter activations of standard RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The need for a system that protects user privacy while maintaining the performance benefits of standard RAG systems motivated the creation of DistilledPRAG, addressing the specific pitfalls of PRAG such as high latency and poor generalization.

**Method:** The DistilledPRAG method involves synthesizing QA pairs from documents to improve reasoning, masking plaintext documents, converting them into LoRA structures that align with standard RAG, and training a parameter generator to match standard RAG's hidden states.

**Result:** Experiments on four QA datasets demonstrate that DistilledPRAG outperforms baselines in accuracy and shows improved generalization on out-of-distribution data.

**Conclusion:** DistilledPRAG advances the field by offering an efficient, privacy-preserving alternative to existing RAG architectures that maintains performance across a variety of tasks, especially on unseen data.

**Abstract:** The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud,
risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding
documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.
However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and
fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,
leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies
solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,
resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,
achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level
performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In
this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled
parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and
parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and
multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the
plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a
parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,
guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard
RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without
original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG
outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文旨在解决在长上下文输入处理过程中因系统延迟和内存需求增加导致的吞吐量降低的问题，特别是在RAG应用中，这种情况更为突出。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种名为REFRAG的高效解码框架，用于检索增强生成（RAG）应用。该框架通过压缩、感知和扩展的方式来优化长上下文的处理，从而减少不必要的计算，同时在保持性能的前提下加速解码过程。

**Result:** 通过利用稀疏结构，REFRAG实现了30.85倍的时间至首令牌加速（相比之前的工作3.75倍改进），并且将语言模型的上下文大小提升了16倍，同时在各种长上下文任务上验证了其有效性。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果显示，REFRAG在不同上下文大小的情况下，相较于LLaMA和其他先进基准模型，在保持准确性的同时实现了显著的加速。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and
agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and
demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced
throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system
efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary
objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In
RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,
with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often
exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during
re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those
in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most
computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be
eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,
an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve
latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we
demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to
previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization
framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs
by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context
tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document
summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm
that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to
LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究自然演化的上下文段落如何影响生成型大语言模型（LLMs）的回答问题的能力。

**Method:** 通过提出一个框架来研究自然演化的上下文段落是如何影响生成型大语言模型（LLMs）的回答问题的能力的。该框架用于从当代问答基准中整理出自然演化的人类编辑的阅读段落变体，并分析在一系列语义相似性分数下LLMs的表现，这些分数量化了每个变体与预训练期间看到的内容的接近程度。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，随着阅读段落自然地与预训练期间遇到的段落偏离，LLMs的表现下降，即使在推理时问题和所有必要的信息依然在场。例如，平均模型在BoolQ上的准确性从最高的相似性区间降低到最低的相似性区间时，下降比例高达30%以上，多个LLMs的斜率超过了70。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现表明，自然文本的演化对LLMs的语言理解能力构成了重大挑战。

**Abstract:** How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question
answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we
propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of
reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM
performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how
closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this
framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available
training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading
passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during
pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains
present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops
by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding
70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution
poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of
LLMs.

Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly
left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based
on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms,
left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved
reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR
checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted
cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised
fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a
padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality
prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement
learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B
Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates
competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We

**Conclusion:** 本文提出的方法为改善非拉丁语系语言在CL-NER任务中的性能提供了一种新的策略和可能性。

**Abstract:** Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge
from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing

transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and
Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To
address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT)
approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a
dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In
addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the
entity alignment from source to target languages.

**Motivation:** 为了解决LLM增强的知识图谱完成方法中的两个关键挑战：自然语言和图结构之间表示空间的不一致以及为不同任务设计单独指令导致的重复工作和时间成本问题。

**Method:** SAT框架通过结构感知对齐调优来增强LLM在知识图谱完成任务中的应用。该方法采用分层知识对齐，通过多任务对比学习将图嵌入与自然语言空间对齐；并通过结构指令调优，指导LLM进行结构感知的图谱推理，使用统一的图指令和轻量级知识适配器。

**Conclusion:** 提出了SAT框架，该框架不仅解决了自然语言和图结构表示空间不一致的问题，同时也减少了为不同任务设计指令的重复工作，显著提高了KGC任务的性能。

**Abstract:** Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make
predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily
focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising
advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing
methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural
language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate
instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and
time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel
framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.
Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align
graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive
learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in
performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph
instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results
on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link

**Abstract:** The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long

However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of
high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both

for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with
LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core
generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded
input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context

and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable,

> 论文提出了一种新的计算框架来解决AI系统的解释性模糊问题，采用法律理论中的机制，显著提高了判断的一致性。这是构建更加稳健且法律合规的AI系统的重要步骤。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 论文旨在解决AI系统中的解释性模糊问题，识别当前对齐管道中的关键差距，并提出解决方案以构建更稳健、遵从法律的AI系统。

**Method:** 通过借鉴法律理论，论文探讨了在规则制定和应用阶段如何约束模糊性，并提出了一个计算框架，该框架模拟了两个法律机制：(1) 规则精炼管道，通过修订模糊规则以最小化解释分歧；(2) 基于提示的解释约束，以减少规则应用中的不一致性。

**Result:** 在WildChat数据集的5000个场景子集上评估该框架，结果表明两种干预措施显著提高了合理解释者之间判断的一致性。

**Conclusion:** 该方法是对有助于系统化管理解释性模糊的基本步骤的第一步，这是构建更加稳健且符合法律规范的AI系统所必需的。

**Abstract:** AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a
key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored:
interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how
these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems
use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent
appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines
offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can
lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we
identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems
constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We
then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a
rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising
ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative
action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce
inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide
judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of
the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve
judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach
offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an
essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

**Motivation:** To tackle the challenge of balancing computational efficiency and performance in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the real world.

**Method:** Zero-Shot Adjustable Acceleration, a method that allows dynamic adjustment of hardware usage during inference without the need for further fine-tuning.

**Result:** The method achieves up to an 11x speedup in comparison to the baseline.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method effectively enhances computational efficiency in Large Language Models without sacrificing performance, through dynamic hardware adjustment during inference.

**Abstract:** Using Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications presents
significant challenges, particularly in balancing computational efficiency and
performance. Optimizing acceleration after the fine-tuning phase and during
inference is crucial for building an efficient architecture. This paper
introduces Zero-Shot Adjustable Acceleration, a novel training and inference
method that dynamically adjusts hardware usage during inference without
requiring additional fine-tuning. The proposed approach is applied to newly
developed models and evaluated across multiple classification and text
generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the method enables a
wide range of acceleration in a zero-shot manner and achieves up to a 11x
speedup compared to the baseline.

**Motivation:** 现有的Simultaneous Speech Translation系统难以在质量、延迟以及语义连贯性上达到平衡，尤其是在多语言转化场景下。SimulMEGA旨在解决这一问题。

**Method:** SimulMEGA结合前缀训练与专家混合精炼器来隐式学习有效的读写策略，适用于语音到文本和文本到语音的流式任务。

**Result:** 评估结果显示，与Seamless基线相比，SimulMEGA在1.5秒的平均延迟下仅损失7%的BLEU值，在3秒为下仅损失3%。

**Conclusion:** SimulMEGA框架通过最小修改标准Transformer架构，能有效提升Simultaneous Speech Translation的质量，并适用于流式TTS任务，证明了其在不同场景中的通用性和适用性。

**Abstract:** Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual
communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation
under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance
translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in
multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies
hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA
(Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy
learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a
Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an
implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires
only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and
generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks.
Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter
speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7
percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3
seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to
streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality
tradeoffs.

### [71] [Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning through Model Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01213)
*Ege Süalp,Mina Rezaei*

Main category: cs.CL

> This paper investigates the use of smaller models to train larger ones to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, particularly for large language models, and finds that the growth-based model (Stack LLM) shows less degradation in learning retention across different tasks compared to a traditional large language model (LLM).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The primary motivation is to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting in large language models undergoing continual learning, which is crucial for maintaining their general utility across diverse applications.

**Method:** The study compares two models: one trained using a growth-based strategy (Stack LLM) and one without (LLM), across fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension, and bias.

**Result:** Both models show improvements in domain knowledge, but Stack LLM shows less degradation in reasoning and reading comprehension tasks, especially the latter, and a more stable bias level over time, indicating better retention capabilities.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that while growth-based pretraining can modestly improve the retention of prior knowledge and help mitigate catastrophic forgetting, there are still trade-offs in handling social biases in these models.

**Abstract:** Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in
which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This
problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing
continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is
important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a
promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the
training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.
Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has
shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains
under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain
previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of
fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,
and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack
LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.
However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating
signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less
degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention
capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes
progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM
maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that
growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting
catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

*Wei Huang,Huang Wei,Yinggui Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

> DaMoC, a Data and Model Compression Framework, is introduced to optimize the selection and fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks by improving data filtering methodologies and compressing models, saving up to 20 times in training time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the challenge of selecting the best open-source large language model (LLM) for fine-tuning domain-specific tasks by introducing a systematic framework that accelerates the process and optimizes the model.

**Method:** The paper presents DaMoC, a framework that consists of data and model compression techniques. Data compression includes categorizing data filtering methodologies into distribution-aware, quality-aware, and hybrid approaches, enhancing key token density, and iterative text rewriting using an LLM. Model compression involves assessing layer importance through layer similarity scores and applying a sparse merging paradigm.

**Result:** Experiments on four datasets show that the proposed framework can select the optimal LLM while reducing training time by approximately 20 times.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that the DaMoC framework effectively addresses the challenges in identifying and optimizing large language models for domain-specific tasks, significantly reducing the required training time.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with
domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many
open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream
tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal
LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses
this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering
methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three
distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,
and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the
density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we
use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model
Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and
remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging
paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.
Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general
Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while
saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

**Motivation:** 本文旨在探索基于上下文学习与预训练先验之间关系的链式思维推理机制。

**Method:** 文章通过细粒度的词法分析来研究模型的推理行为，并通过逐步引入带有噪声的例子来考察模型在先验和上下文信息之间的权衡。此外，文章还探讨了提示工程是否能激发大型语言模型的逐步推理能力。

**Result:** 研究发现：(1)模型能够快速学习词法层面的推理结构并掌握深层逻辑推理模式，但高度依赖预训练先验。(2)提供足够的示例能够促使模型决策从依赖预训练先验转向上下文信号，而误导提示会导致不稳定。(3)长链式思维提示能够促使模型生成更长的推理链，提高其在下游任务上的性能。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，通过关键的提示工程与大量示例，可以改进大型语言模型的推理能力，使其在复杂任务中表现更佳。

**Abstract:** Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing
model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the
working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the
dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first
conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the
model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars,
we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous
in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can
induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal
three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning
structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning
patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient
exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to
in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long
Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning
chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

**Conclusion:** 该研究提出了一种新的方法来理解情绪的文本表达，以及通过语言模型捕捉情感标注过程中的变异性规律。

**Abstract:** Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in
society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual
manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated
following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which
is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements
traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit
significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable
statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we
demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that
variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our
results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional
situations based on evaluative criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前用于评估大型语言模型文化对齐的“琐事中心范式”越来越不足以应对这些模型越来越先进和广泛应用的要求。现有的方法通常将文化简化为静态的事实或价值观，这种简化忽略了文化的多样性和互动现实，也忽视了文化假设如何渗透到看似“中立”的评估环境之中。

**Method:** 本文提出一种新的评估方法，称为“有意文化评估”，这种方法系统地检查评估中嵌入的所有方面的文化假设，而不仅仅是显式文化任务中的假设。

**Result:** 本文强调研究者地位的重要性，以促进包容性和文化对齐的自然语言处理研究，并讨论了超越当前基准实践、发现重要新应用以及通过HCI启发的参与式方法让社区参与评估设计的未来方向。

**Conclusion:** 为实现更有文化敏感性和包容性的自然语言处理（NLP）研究，需要批判性地评估评估方法中嵌入的文化假设，采用有意文化评估方法，并考虑研究者的地位。未来工作将重点探讨如何发现未知新应用并通过人类计算接口（HCI）方式让社区参与评估设计。

**Abstract:** The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural
alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these
models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically
reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or
short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods
neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how
cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings.
In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural
evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions
embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks.
We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which
culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the
importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally
aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions
for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important
applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation
design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

**Motivation:** 由于大语言模型在工业应用中面临结构异质性、目标数据定位困难和复杂推理瓶颈等问题，该研究旨在通过TableZoomer框架解决这些问题。

**Method:** 该论文提出了TableZoomer，这是一个基于大语言模型的编程代理框架，包含三个关键创新：一是用结构化的表格模式替换原始的全口头表格，以减少计算复杂度；二是通过列选择与实体链接的动态生成子表格模式，提高目标定位效率；三是利用Program-of-Thoughts（PoT）策略，将查询转换为可执行代码以减轻数值幻觉。还将推理流程与ReAct范式集成，实现迭代推理。

**Result:** 在大规模的DataBench数据集和小规模的TableBench数据集的Fact Checking任务上，使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct大语言模型实现的TableZoomer框架，分别在准确性上提高了19.34%和25%。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，TableZoomer框架保持了大语言模型的可用性优势，并显著提升了大规模和小规模表格数据集上的性能和可扩展性。

**Abstract:** While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question
answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in
industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in
target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address
these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered,
programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1)
replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to
bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware
table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through
column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target
localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that
transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination.
Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to
enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing
performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented
with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of
19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench
dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 虽然大语言模型能够解决广泛任务，但由于占用了大量计算资源且时间成本高，将其直接微调到新领域的效率较低，尤其是面对低资源领域时。因此，本研究旨在探索更有效的微调策略，特别是在存在数据限制的情况下。

**Method:** 本研究利用参数高效的微调技术（PEFTs）在高资源数据集上进行微调，以提高模型在未见过的低资源领域的性能。研究人员测试了六种PEFTs技术，使用的模型是Llama-3-8B-Instruct，实验涵盖14个来自科学、医疗、法律和新闻领域的训练数据集，主要任务是文本摘要。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，对于低资源领域，使用领域内适应器进行推理可以取得比少量样本情况和更大模型（如Llama-3-70B-Instruct）更好的性能。如果没有领域内适应器，跨领域的适应器以及适应器的组合也可以利用跨域语言的内在相似性，提升低资源环境下的适应性和性能。

**Conclusion:** 研究结论表明，参数高效的微调技术通过适应器在特定领域内训练，可有效提高大语言模型对低资源领域的适应性，并且超越了传统微调和更大模型的效果，在资源有限的情况下提供了有效的解决方案。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile.
However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are
speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally,
the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging
when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is
unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on
high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on
unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether
intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for
efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with
\texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific,
Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments
show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can
achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger
\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain
Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the
strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities
across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in
low-resource settings.

**Abstract:** We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic
capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash
adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic
computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per
token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)
Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap
window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput
compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling
framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth
initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation
to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy
among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete
model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving
over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million
output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we
conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted
mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further
augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers
highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional
strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is

**Motivation:** 现有基准未能评估开放性和基于法律条文的问答，因此需要一个新基准来评估多步法律推理。

**Method:** 提出KoBLEX和ParSeR方法，ParSeR采用三阶段顺序检索过程，使用LLM生成参数化法律条文来指导推理。

**Result:** 实验表明ParSeR在多个模型中优于强大基线，比标准检索GPT-4o高出+37.91 F1和+30.81 LF-Eval分数。

**Conclusion:** ParSeR提供了在不同推理深度上的一致性能，并通过消融分析确认了其有效性。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general
domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks
have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these
benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question
Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal
EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop
legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their
supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We
also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval
(ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally
grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on
complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a
three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the
legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation
(LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question,
answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human
judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms
strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably,
compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1
and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently
delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations
confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

> 本研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂纸牌游戏中的应用和学习能力，发现它们可以通过微调实现优秀游戏表现，同时在通用能力与游戏专项能力之间寻找平衡。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 探索LLMs在掌握复杂纸牌游戏方面的能力，特别是在经过高质量游戏数据微调后，能否达到类似AlphaGo, AlphaZero, MuZero在围棋和国际象棋中击败顶级人类玩家的成就。

**Method:** 通过监督微调高质量游戏数据，系统评估了LLMs在八种多样化的纸牌游戏中的学习能力，同时考察了模型在掌握这些游戏时保持通用能力的情况。

**Result:** 发现LLMs可以通过监督微调高质量数据接近强劲游戏AI的性能；能够同时掌握多个复杂纸牌游戏，对于规则相似的游戏性能增强，而对于规则不同的游戏则会产生冲突；当掌握复杂游戏时，通用能力有所下降，但通过结合一定量的通用指令数据可以缓解这一下降。

**Conclusion:** 评估结果证明了LLMs在学习能力和适应性方面的强大能力。

**Abstract:** Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress
of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have
defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal
attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models
(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the
question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this
paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We
systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse
card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,
and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while
mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the
performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality
data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with
performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for
dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when
mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a
certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate
strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

> 论文提出了一种方法，通过提取和简单算术运算来转移大规模语言模型的推理能力，从而在不同的推理基准测试中改进模型性能。这种方法为合理再利用计算资源提供了实用途径。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 减少大型语言模型优化推理任务时的高昂成本，以及在模型间有效迁移复杂推理能力的需求。

**Method:** 通过提取两个初始参数相同的Qwen2.5模型（一个用监督微调SFT训练，另一个用组相对策略优化GRPO训练）的参数差异来得到一个表示推理能力的向量。理论基础是这个向量可以将两个模型之间的差异归因于推理能力的提升。

**Result:** 推理向量在多种推理基准测试中提升了模型的性能，表现出在不同条件下的一致性。反向操作减去该向量会造成性能下降，进一步验证了该向量对提升推理能力的重要性。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，推理能力可以通过简单的张量算术重新用于改进现有模型，提供了利用先期计算投资的一种实用方法。

**Abstract:** Large language models often require costly optimization, such as
reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work
demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and
transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly
available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning
vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We
hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by
reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT
process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple
arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse
reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and
BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist
under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes
significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the
vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work
shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive
training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through
simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by
recycling prior computational investments.

**Motivation:** 解决在线伤害问题，特别是仇恨言论，通过结合自动化工具的速度和规模与人工审核员的判断力。旨在增强平台信任并解释内容为何被认为是有害的，从而增加透明度。

**Method:** 提出WATCHED聊天机器人，结合大型语言模型和其他专业工具，用于识别和解释仇恨言论。系统通过与真实仇恨言论和中性内容比较、使用基于BERT的分类器标记有害信息、查阅俚语词典、生成推理链和参考平台政策来进行检测和解释。

**Result:** 实际结果显示，提出的方法超越现有最先进的方法，达到了0.91的宏观F1得分。

**Conclusion:** 此工具有助于减轻在线伤害，促进AI和人工监督之间的协作，适合内容审核员、安全团队和研究者使用。

**Abstract:** Online harms are a growing problem in digital spaces, putting user safety at
risk and reducing trust in social media platforms. One of the most persistent
forms of harm is hate speech. To address this, we need tools that combine the
speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human
moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain
their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this
paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in
tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent
system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It
compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses
a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and
informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates
chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and
support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect
hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both
precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method
surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91.
Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce
online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 理解文档之间的细粒度关系对许多应用领域来说是至关重要的。然而，由于缺乏有效方法来创建跨文档链接的训练和评估数据集，自动辅助研究受到限制。为了克服这一限制，我们开发了一种新的框架来解决这一问题。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种新的领域无关框架，用于选择最佳方法并从头开始标注跨文档链接。首先，我们生成和验证半合成的互连文档数据集，用于自动评估，以筛选出表现最好的链接方法。然后，使用这些方法进行详细的人类评估研究，以获取自然文本对的表现估计。

**Result:** 我们应用框架在两个不同领域——同行评审和新闻——展示了将检索模型与大语言模型（LLMs）结合使用可以从人类评分者那里获得78%的链接批准，比单独使用强大的检索器提高了两倍以上的精度。

**Conclusion:** 我们的框架能系统地研究跨文档理解在各种应用情景中的应用，且创建的新型数据集为诸如媒体框架、同行评审等跨文档任务奠定了基础。我们公开了代码、数据和标注协议。

**Abstract:** Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many
application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by
the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of
cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic
framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating
cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and
validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used
to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing
linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human
evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We
apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show
that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from
human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our
framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across
application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for
numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the
code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

**Motivation:** 研究的动机在于理解NAC令牌序列的结构，并指导更加有效的生成式语音模型的设计。

**Method:** 通过比较分析不同NAC模型生成的离散语音令牌的语言统计规律如齐普夫定律和海夫斯定律，以及它们的熵和冗余性，并通过评估自动语音识别的错误率和使用UTMOS评分来评价合成语音的清晰度和质量来进行研究。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，神经音频编解码器（NAC）中的3-gram令牌表现出类似语言的统计模式，并且这些属性与语音识别和语音重构任务的性能改善密切相关。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现揭示了NAC令牌之间的关系，并指出这些属性与语言统计规律的遵守之间存在联系，为设计更加有效的生成式语音模型提供了见解。

**Abstract:** This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic
properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens
produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic
statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy
and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic
and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility
using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS
score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit
language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with
measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved
performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer
insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of
more effective generative speech models.

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型在解决数学问题上的表现虽然出色，但它们在元推理任务上表现不佳，例如识别学生解题过程中的错误。研究动机是为了探究如何更好地定位学生解题过程中首次出现的错误。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种生成中间修正学生解题过程的方法，这与原始的学生解题过程更为接近，有助于提高准确性。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，最先进语言模型在给定参考解题过程的情况下，仍难以准确识别学生的解题过程中的首次错误。所提出的方法有助于缓解这一问题。

**Conclusion:** 尽管在使用大型语言模型定位学生解题过程中的首次错误存在困难，但通过生成中间修正解题过程的方法显示出了一定的改进潜力。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word
problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such
as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the
challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two
error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student
solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we
propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution,
aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型（LLMs）通过链式思维（CoT）提示展示出强大的推理能力，但这一过程是不透明的，这使得在高风险环境中验证、调试和控制变得困难。

**Method:** 提出了Vis-CoT框架，将线性的CoT文本转换为可交互的理由图。用户可以可视化逻辑流程、识别错误步骤并干预，从而纠正错误路径并添加新的用户定义前提。

**Result:** 在GSM8K和StrategyQA数据集上，与非交互基线相比，Vis-CoT将最终答案的准确性提高到了24个百分点。此外，用户研究还显示出在感知易用性和信任度方面的显著提升。

**Conclusion:** Vis-CoT展示了一条实用的路径，通过将LLMs与有针对性的人类监督相结合，实现更可靠、可理解且协作的推理。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and
control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a
human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive
reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps,
and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined
premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active
collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy
conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer
accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user
study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points
to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative
reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

> 通过基于WVS的评估框架，系统评估LLMs在全球各国、语言及历史时期的与人类意见的对齐情况，结果表明改变提示语言可以改善LLMs的对齐状况。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的研究主要集中在少数国家的LLMs对齐问题上，缺少全球样本以及不同历史时期人类意见的研究，也没有讨论如何使用语言来引导LLMs。

**Method:** 创建了一个基于世界价值观调查（WVS）的评估框架来系统性地评估LLMs在全球不同国家、语言和历史时期的与人类意见的对齐情况。

**Result:** 研究发现，LLMs对于某些国家的意见过于或适当对齐，而对于大多数国家却未能对齐。改变问题提示的语言，可以使LLMs更好地与相应国家的意见对齐，同时LLMs更倾向于对齐当代人群的意见。

**Conclusion:** 本研究首次对LLMs在全球范围内的意见对齐问题进行了全面调查。

**Abstract:** Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual
scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When
LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align
with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by
the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies
mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic
groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country
samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well
as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also
overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs'
opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create
an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to
systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across
different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We
find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few
countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore,
changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the
questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the
corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the
same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary
population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive
investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global,
language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at

> 介绍了UniCR框架，该框架通过将不确定性证据转变为校准概率，并根据用户定义的误差预算进行决策，从而提高了语言模型的回答可靠性，实验结果表明该方法优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 语言模型必须决定何时回答，何时不应该回答。为了提高模型的可靠性，特别是在面对不确定性时，作者提出了UniCR框架。

**Method:** UniCR是一个综合框架，它将包括序列似然性、自一致性散度、检索兼容性和工具或验证器反馈在内的异构不确定性证据转化为校准的正确性概率，并通过原则性的拒绝策略实施用户指定的误差预算。UniCR通过温度缩放和恰当的评分学习了一个轻量的校准头，并且支持仅通过API的模型通过黑盒特征进行操作。它使用无分布保证的合规风险控制，并通过从检索到的证据中得出的原子事实分数进行监督，以对长形式生成的信心进行校准，从而减少自信的幻觉，同时保持覆盖面。

**Result:** 实验在短形式问答、代码生成（附带执行测试）和检索增强的长形式问答中展示了校准指标的一致改善，降低了风险-覆盖面下的面积，并在固定风险下提高了覆盖面，优于熵或logit阈值、事后校准器和端到端的选择基线。分析表明，证据矛盾、语义分散和工具不一致性是主要的拒绝因素，产生了有用的用户拒绝信息。

**Conclusion:** UniCR提供了一个可移植的不确定性证据融合到校准概率再到风险控制决策的方案，从而提高了模型的信任度，而无需调整基础模型，并在分布变化下保持有效。

**Abstract:** Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when
not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous
uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency
dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a
calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error
budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with
temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through
black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal
risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic
fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved
evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage.
Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and
retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration
metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed
risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and
end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction,
semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of
abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a
portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled
decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and
remains valid under distribution shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型（LLM）在训练完成后是静态的，这使得通过全面的重新训练及时整合新事实的成本极高。因此，出现了知识编辑技术，但它们要么过分依赖表面线索，要幺需要复杂且迭代的流水线，这在噪音大或多跳条件下容易崩溃。

**Method:** 我们提出了Reason-KE，这是一种基于推理链的知识编辑框架，它指导预训练的LLM通过四个结构化的阶段：事实确认、相关性判定、选择性应用和最终推理，以在一次通过中过滤掉干扰项。

**Result:** 在MQuAKE-CF上训练，并处理多达四个无关事实，Reason-KE将Qwen2.5-7B的多跳QA准确性提高到了90.2%，即使在高度干扰的情况下，其性能仅下降6.3%，而在答案被泄露的情况下下降不到1%。

**Conclusion:** 定量分析证实了Reason-KE的稳健性和效率，确立了它在可靠的LLM知识更新方面的最先进地位。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but
remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts
prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have
thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either
over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that
collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an
end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM
through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination,
selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single
pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates
Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop
under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative
analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

**Motivation:** 当前研究主要关注减少语言模型产生的事实错误响应（幻觉）的方法，但忽略了对检索增强语言模型（RALMs）拒绝能力的评估。本文旨在探讨RALMs是否知道自己未知的状态。

**Method:** 我们评估了检索增强语言模型（RALMs）在不同内部和外部知识状态下的表现，并研究了拒绝后训练的影响。特别关注过度拒绝行为及其在不同调优方法下的变化，如拒绝感知指令调优（R-tuning）和上下文微调。

**Result:** 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同情境下表现出过度拒绝的行为。拒绝感知指令调优（R-tuning）增加了过度拒绝的问题，而上下文微调则缓解了这一问题。然而，拒绝能力可能会降低答案质量。最终，我们为拒绝后训练的模型开发了一种简单有效的拒绝方法。

**Conclusion:** 本研究提供了一个更全面的理解，关于关键因素如知识状态和调优方法如何影响检索增强语言模型（RALMs）的行为。

**Abstract:** Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet
factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are
primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval
Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current
research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while
overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study,
we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know?
Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated
regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the
influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs
exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal
post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware
Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that
the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified
by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with
the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal
method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality
in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more
comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于RAG系统通常采用简单的top-k语义搜索机制，容易引入无关或冗余信息，从而降低性能和效率。因此，提出了MeVe这一新的模块化架构，用于记忆验证和智能上下文组成。

**Method:** MeVe提出了一种五阶段模块化设计，重新思考了RAG范式。它将检索和上下文组成过程分解为五个独立的阶段：初步检索、相关性验证、备用检索、上下文优先级排序和标记预算分配。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，与标准的RAG实现相比，MeVe在Wikipedia数据集上实现了57%的上下文效率提升，在更复杂的HotpotQA数据集上则实现了75%的效率提升。

**Conclusion:** MeVe为更可扩展和可靠的LLM应用程序提供了一个框架，并通过优化和提取上下文信息提供了更好的事实支持。

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints
because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The
approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant
information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This
paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory
Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by
proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval
and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently
tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,
context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables
fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling
task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation
of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy
QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that
by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly
improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset
and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard
RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and
reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information,
MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support
[16].

**Conclusion:** 研究结论显示，虽然两个工会都涉及社区相关主题，他们的参与模式存在显著差异，挑战了社区工会主义在时间和部门上连续性和普遍性的假设。

**Abstract:** This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two
distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe
Union (B\&S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using
BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency
analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns
with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement,
and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in
thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates
stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the
B\&S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and
member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union
model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how
modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives.
Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with
community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge
significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of
community unionism across time and sector.

> 本研究提出了一种新方法（CAT）在LLMs的注意力机制中注入因果知识，以提高其预测性能，实验结果显示这种方法在多种场景下具有良好的效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管大型语言模型在诸多领域取得了显著的成功，但这些模型直接用大规模数据训练后，往往捕捉的是虚假相关而不是真正因果关系，这导致了在分布外（OOD）场景下的预测性能较差。研究旨在通过更好地利用因果知识，提高语言模型在预测和生成任务中的表现并增强其在OOD场景下的鲁棒性。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为因果注意力调优（Causal Attention Tuning, CAT）的新方法，该方法在注意力机制中注入细粒度的因果知识来解决大规模数据训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）容易捕捉到虚假相关而非真正因果关系的问题。通过结合人类先验的知识，全自动地生成标记级别的因果信号，并引入重新注意力机制来指导训练，这种方法有助于模型专注于因果结构，同时减少注意力分数中的噪声和偏见。

**Result:** 实验结果在新的“虚假令牌游戏”（Spurious Token Game, STG）基准测试和多个下游任务上的验证了该方法能有效地利用因果知识进行预测，并在OOD场景下保持了良好的表现。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，通过CAT方法注入因果知识可以显著改善LLMs在预测和生成任务中的表现，特别是在OOD场景下的预测性能。这为提升模型的鲁棒性和性能提供了一种有效的方法。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize
causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we
find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious
correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal
performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that
injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose
an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate
token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide
training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise
and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious
Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our
approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains
robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at

> 我们研究了将API文档转换为结构化API图的问题，该图捕捉API依赖，并提出In-N-Out数据集来提高多工具查询的能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 工具代理，即基于LLM并交互外部API的系统，能够执行真实世界任务。但随着任务复杂性的增加，这些代理难以正确识别并按顺序调用API。因此，我们提出了一种新的方法来改善此问题。

**Method:** 我们引入了In-N-Out，这是首个基于两个真实世界API基准及其文档构建的专家标注的API图数据集。通过将API文档转化为捕捉API依赖性并在多工具查询中使用的结构化API图，以解决复杂的多工具查询所需的组合API调用问题。

**Result:** 使用In-N-Out显著提高了工具检索和多工具查询生成的表现，几乎使仅依赖文档的LLM的性能翻倍。在In-N-Out上微调的模型生成的图能够达到90%的性能差距，表明我们的数据集有助于模型理解API文档和参数关系。

**Conclusion:** 我们的研究展示了使用显式API图对于工具代理的前景和In-N-Out作为有价值的资源的实用性。我们将在公开发布数据集和代码。

**Abstract:** Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a
way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex,
these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper
order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into
a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for
multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we
introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from
two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out
significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query
generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover,
graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap,
showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and
parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit
API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource.
We will release the dataset and code publicly.

> 本文提出了EAGLE方法，通过利用大型语言模型的内部隐藏状态来生成更准确的信心分数，从而改进模型的校准性能。实验表明，EAGLE显著优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理任务中表现出显著的成功，但通常表现出过度自信并生成可信但错误的答案。这种过度自信，特别是在经过人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）的模型中，对可靠性和安全部署提出了挑战。因此需要一个可以改进模型校准性能的新方法。

**Method:** 提出EAGLE（基于聚合内部信念的预期自我评估校准方法），该方法利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的内部隐藏状态来生成更准确的信心分数。EAGLE在自我评估过程中从多个中间层提取内部信念，聚合这些层的信念并计算得到的信心分数分布的期望值，从而生成一个更能反映模型内部确定性的改进信心分数。

**Result:** 在多种数据集和大型语言模型上的广泛实验表明，EAGLE显著提升了校准表现，并优于现有基线方法。

**Conclusion:** EAGLE方法通过改进信心分数的生成方式，有助于更准确地反映模型的内部确定性，从而提高模型的可靠性和安全性。此外，研究还深入分析了EAGLE的不确定性模式、自我评估提示的影响以及自我评估分数范围的效果。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate
plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models
undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant
challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this
paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel
self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden
states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on
the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple
intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise
beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score
distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully
reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration
performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
EAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of
the impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of
self-evaluation score range.

> 研究发现，句子嵌入空间的几何结构并不能预测其在语言任务上的表现。句子中的语言信息是通过不同维度的加权组合来编码的，与它们在空间中的距离无关。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 探讨句子嵌入空间的几何结构是否能够预测其在不同任务上的相对表现。

**Method:** 通过三种方式计算句子嵌入：平均词嵌入、特殊[CLS]标记的嵌入以及句子中随机标记的嵌入。研究探讨了句子嵌入变体之间的距离与它们在语言任务上的表现是否存在相关性，以及尽管它们之间的距离不同，它们是否以相同的方式编码相同的信息。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，句子嵌入的几何距离与它们在语言任务上的表现无直接关系，因此与句子所编码的语言信息无直接关系。

**Conclusion:** 结果表明，余弦相似性捕获了句子嵌入之间的（浅层）共性或差异，但并不能预测它们在特定任务上的表现。语言信息实际上是通过不同维度的加权组合来编码的，这些组合并未反映在句子嵌入空间的几何结构中。

**Abstract:** Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce
contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into
the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are
close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words
corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that
are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for
sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and
show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their
relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings,
as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random
token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the
distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on
linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same
information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions
shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence
embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks.
Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different
dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding
space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于现代中文诗歌具有独特特点，使得难以识别诗歌是人类创作还是AI生成的，尤其是在现实的中文世界中，对于识别由LLMs生成的现代中文诗歌有着紧迫的需求。

**Method:** 本研究构建了一个高质量的数据集，其中包括6位专业诗人创作的800首现代中文诗歌和由4个主流大型语言模型生成的41,600首诗歌。然后，我们对六个检测器在这个数据集上的表现进行了系统评估。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，目前的检测器无法作为可靠工具来检测LLMs生成的现代中文诗歌。特别难以检测的是诗歌的内在特质，尤其是风格。

**Conclusion:** 本论文为未来检测AI生成诗歌的工作奠定了基础。

**Abstract:** The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made
AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on
detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved
modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese
poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or
AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly
disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying
AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel
benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first
construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six
professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.
Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on
this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be
used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The
most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially
style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of
AI-generated poetry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 自动作文评分（AES）提供了对学生作文评估的重要替代方案，但目前的方法受到静态词嵌入无法捕捉词义背景，以及整体评分缺失对语法、词汇和连贯性等特定写作方面评估的局限性。本研究提出TransGAT旨在解决这些问题。

**Method:** TransGAT结合了微调的Transformer模型与图注意力网络（GAT），以实现对作文的分析评分。具体来说，TransGAT采用了两流预测结合的方法，每一流都包含一个经过微调的Transformer（BERT、RoBERTa或DeBERTaV3）与一个独立的GAT。第一流生成作文级别的预测，而第二流则应用GAT在Transformer的词嵌入上进行预测，构建的边来自于句法依赖关系。模型最终将两个流的预测融合起来以产生最终的分析评分。

**Result:** 在ELLIPSE数据集上的实验结果表明，TransGAT在所有分析评分维度上的平均Quadratic Weighted Kappa达到了0.854，优于基线模型，证明了其在作文评分中的优越性能。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果证明了TransGAT在提升AES系统性能的潜力。

**Abstract:** Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual
scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent
studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static
word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for
polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,
overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.
To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach
that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.
TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the
relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs
two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,
and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates
essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token
embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then
fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.
Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline
models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all
analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT
to advance AES systems.

**Motivation:** The motivation is to develop a means to calculate the similarity between words based on their phonetic transcription, aiming for efficient processing of large datasets.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that the proposed method is both feasible and effective for analyzing the phonetic structure of languages, with potential for expansion to cover other languages.

**Abstract:** We present a method to calculate the similarity between words based on their
phonetic transcription (their pronunciation) using the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm. We implement this algorithm in Rust and parallelize it on both CPU
and GPU to handle large datasets efficiently. The GPU implementation leverages
CUDA and the cudarc Rust library to achieve significant performance
improvements. We validate our approach by constructing a fully-connected graph
where nodes represent words and edges have weights according to the similarity
between the words. This graph is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to
identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic
structure of languages. It might be easily expanded to other languages.

**Conclusion:** 通过结合新闻的意图和语义信号进行虚假新闻检测，可以更好地理解和应对新闻造假的内在动机，提出的方法在效果上具有明显的优势。

**Abstract:** Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online
information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract
news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,
stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues
can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in
dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news
landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective
by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and
semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one
can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than
the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose
Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,
which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via
graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and
intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context
interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and
implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve
better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic
pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and
aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Abdelkrime Aries*

Main category: cs.CL

> Error

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural
language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.
However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated
models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex
morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical
influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization
and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained
language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that
rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design
allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending
on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from
diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber
Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and
linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of
Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a
multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive
evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for
downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of
character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and
lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

> 该研究挑战了语言模型提示敏感性的普遍看法，发现此现象更多是评估方法导致的假象，而非模型本身的缺陷。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 对于广泛报道的大型语言模型显著的提示敏感性，研究者质疑这是否是语言模型的固有弱点，还是主要源于评估过程的问题。

**Method:** 该研究系统地评估了7个大型语言模型（例如GPT和Gemini家族）在6种基准测试上的表现，这些基准测试包括多项选择题和开放性问题，使用了12种不同的提示模板。研究通过采用大型语言模型作为法官的评估方法，减少了性能方差，并提高了模型排名在不同提示下的相关性。

**Result:** 研究发现，许多提示敏感性问题源于启发式评估方法，如对数似然评分和严格的答案匹配。这些评估方式经常忽略表述方式不同但语义正确的回答，如同义词或同义句。当采用大型语言模型作为法官的评估方法时，性能方差显著减少，模型排名的一致性也更高。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，现代大型语言模型比之前认为的更能够适应提示模板，提示敏感性可能是评估过程中的产物，而非模型本身的弱点。

**Abstract:** Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e.,
repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to
significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely
accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and
ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness
of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this
question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)
across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12
diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems
from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid
answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed
through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance
variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across
prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt
templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an
artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

**Motivation:** 论文旨在通过审查新兴证据，理解基于Transformer的大语言模型（LLMs）驱动的AI面试官在实时语音调查中何时适用于定量和定性研究的数据收集。

**Method:** 本论文通过评估AI面试官和当前互动语音应答(IVR)系统在输入/输出性能（如语音识别、答案记录、情绪管理）和口头推理（如探查、澄清、处理分支逻辑）两个维度的能力，来评估其对于定量和定性研究数据收集的适用性。

**Result:** 田野研究表明，AI面试官在定量和定性数据收集方面已经超过了IVR系统的能力，但实时转录错误率高、情绪检测能力有限和后续跟进质量不均等问题表明，AI面试官技术的实际效用、使用和接受程度可能在定性数据收集工作中受具体情境影响。

**Conclusion:** AI面试官技术尽管在定量和定性数据收集方面有一定优势，但仍存在一些问题，可能需要根据特定的研究场景来决定其使用。

**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI
interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in
real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when
such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within
quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of
AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems
across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition,
answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to
probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI
interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and
qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited
emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the
utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be
context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

**Motivation:** 传统的机器学习方法在有效提取关键患者信息方面常常遇到困难，这使得临床医生难以有效地利用这些工具进行患者护理。本研究旨在解决这一问题，从而改善从EHR中抽取患者信息的准确性，并提高其在临床决策中的实用性。

**Result:** 本研究证明，在医疗AI方面的重大进展，提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，改进了EHR中信息提取的准确性和可用性，从而帮助临床医生做出更明智的决策以及提升了患者护理的结果。

**Conclusion:** 这项研究展示了大型语言模型和文本生成方法在改进EHR信息提取准确性中的潜力，这种改进不仅提高了数据解释的透明度，还适应了医疗数据稀缺性的问题，并且提高了医疗决策的准确性。

**Abstract:** The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured
nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to
capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to
utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel
approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task
from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide
reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach
enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled
data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of
evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by
proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics.
This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT
Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent
of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant
advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that
improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs,
thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing
patient care outcomes.

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种弱监督方法，用于在没有人工标注的情况下自动抽取和链接病人的主诉记录中的实体。首先采用分割和匹配算法生成弱标注，包括实体提及跨度和类别标签。然后使用基于BERT的模型，通过生成的弱标签定位主诉文本中的实体提及，并将它们链接到预定义的本体。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，本研究所提出的方法在不使用任何人工标注的情况下，比以前的方法表现更好。

**Conclusion:** 研究结论是，这种方法能够在没有人类注释的情况下有效地从主诉记录中抽取和链接实体，为标准化和文本挖掘提供了更优的解决方案。

**Abstract:** A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the
patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a
patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text
mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering
methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it
difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record
keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to
automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of
human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak
annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million
real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we
train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions
in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted
extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity
Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over
previous methods without any human annotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决当事人之间的争议通常需要在特定的平台上进行，通过呈现事实、讨论分歧点、听取论点及具体要求，最终由法官裁决，本文旨在使用LLMs减少这一过程中的工作量和提高效率。

**Method:** 提出DRAssist系统，该系统能提取争议的关键结构元素并生成结构化的争议摘要。系统通过不同的提示策略和多种大型语言模型来协助解决争议。

**Result:** LLMs分别在识别争议中的强势方、判断特定要求是否可接受以及评估各方论点强弱这三方面产生决议输出，通过与相关基线对比评估了其在这三个任务上的表现。

**Conclusion:** 研究展示了大型语言模型在协助人类法官解决特定领域争议中的潜力，提出了可行的方法和技术。

**Abstract:** Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation,
insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a
specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of
disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the
parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often
favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such
disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two
specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist
identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or
disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured
dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then
explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to
assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are
prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i)
identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each
specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate
whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate
the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant
baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

*Chao Xue,Ziyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

> The paper introduces StructCoh, a method that uses graph-based contrastive learning to enhance text semantic matching by integrating structural and semantic features, demonstrating superior performance in legal and academic document matching tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper aims to address the limitations of pre-trained language models in capturing hierarchical structural patterns and handling subtle semantic discrimination in text semantic matching.

**Method:** A graph-enhanced contrastive learning framework called StructCoh is proposed, which combines structural reasoning with representation space optimization. It uses a dual-graph encoder for semantic graph construction and a hierarchical contrastive objective to maintain consistency at multiple levels.

**Result:** The experiments conducted on legal document matching and academic plagiarism detection datasets show that StructCoh outperforms existing methods, achieving an 86.7% F1-score on legal statute matching.

**Conclusion:** The study verifies the effectiveness of StructCoh's approach in improving text semantic matching through the integration of structural reasoning and contrastive learning.

**Abstract:** Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural
relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained
language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often
overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic
discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced
contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural
reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key
innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency
parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to
propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document
concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at
multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core
semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document
structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling
strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and
academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score
(+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying
argument structure similarities.

**Motivation:** 虽然大型语言模型在医疗保健领域具有变革潜力，但其解读纵向患者叙述的能力尚需进一步探索。牙科领域丰富的结构化临床数据为严格评估这些模型的推理能力提供了独特机会。

**Method:** 评估了四个前沿的大型语言模型（GPT-4o，Gemini 2.0 Flash，Copilot 和 DeepSeek V3）在分析纵向牙科病例叙述方面的表现。利用了34个标准化的纵向牙周病例（包含258对问答），通过自动化指标和执业牙医的盲评来评估模型的表现。

**Result:** DeepSeek在忠实度指标上的得分最高（中位数为0.528，相对于其他模型的0.367-0.457），在专家评分中也得到较高的评价（中位数为4.5/5，相对于4.0/5），并且在可读性方面没有显著下降。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明DeepSeek是目前最适用于案例分析的大型语言模型，建议将其作为医学教育和研究的辅助工具，并且在牙科领域具有特定的应用潜力。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet
their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains
inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured
clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs'
reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a
model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the
competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini
2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal
dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized
longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we
assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by
licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating
superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert
ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising
readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis,
endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and
research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

**Motivation:** 虽然大型语言模型在生成合成数据方面表现出色，但确保其质量和多样性仍然是一项挑战。为了克服这一挑战，我们提出了遗传提示框架。

**Method:** 通过将语义文本属性视为基因序列并利用大型语言模型（LLM）模拟交叉和突变操作，结合遗传算法和LLM，提出了一种名为遗传提示（Genetic Prompt）的新框架，以增强合成数据的质量和多样性。此外，我们集成了主动学习方案以优化父样本选择，从而扩大子代搜索空间。

**Result:** 在多个NLP任务上的实验显示，遗传提示不仅显著优于最先进的基线，而且在各种生成器模型大小和规模上都表现出强大的性能。此外，我们展示与将原始训练集融合我们的合成数据大大提高了下游模型的性能，特别是对于类别不平衡的情况。

**Conclusion:** 我们的研究证明，遗传提示是一个有效的方法，可以用来为广泛的NLP应用生产高质量的合成数据。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring
its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a
novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic
data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences
and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This
genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute
combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To
optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that
expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks
reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various
generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our
synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream
model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings
validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality
synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

**Motivation:** 研究旨在探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成具有精确字数限制文本的显式长度约束方面的差异，特别是在英语和意大利语中，基础模型与其指令调优后的模型之间有何不同。

**Method:** 本研究通过使用累积加权归因(Cumulative Weighted Attribution)这一从直接逻辑归因(Direct Logit Attribution)派生出的指标，分析了基础模型与接受指令调优后的模型在英意双语中生成符合长度限制文本时表现及内部组件的贡献。

**Result:** 研究表明，指令调优显著提高长度控制能力，主要通过特化深层模型层的组件。特别是在英语中，调优后的模型后期层的注意力头显示出增加的正贡献。而在意大利语中，尽管注意力贡献减弱，后期层的MLP模块显示出更强大的正贡献，显示出补偿机制。

**Conclusion:** 研究揭示，指令调优重新配置了后期层以适应任务要求，且组件级别的策略可能适应语言背景。

**Abstract:** Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a
precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation
models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text
generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal
component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived
from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning
substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in
deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models
show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian,
while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a
stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results
indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence,
with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

**Motivation:** 传统的提示优化大多集中在直接的提示改进或模型微调，忽略了利用大型语言模型固有的推理能力来从对比示例中学习。

**Method:** 该论文提出了一种名为对比推理提示优化（CRPO）的框架，将提示优化定义为一个检索增强的推理过程。该方法从HelpSteer2数据集中检索顶级参考提示，该数据集包含了关于有用性、正确性、连贯性、复杂性和冗长度的注释，并构建了两种互补的优化范式：分层对比推理和多指标对比推理。

**Result:** CRPO方法在HelpSteer2基准上的实验结果显著优于基线方法。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果证明了基于对比和检索增强推理的自动提示优化的有效性。

**Abstract:** Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for
improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the
goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work
focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the
potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from
contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt
Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a
retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference
prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for
helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs
two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,
where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own
generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive
reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation
dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By
explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model
to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more
robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2
benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our
findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning
for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

**Motivation:** 当前的大型语言模型评估面临着诸如与目标互动有限、难度控制不足和难以验证评估结果有效性的挑战。因此，我们需要一种新的评估范式来准确地确定目标模型的知识和能力边界。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种称为JudgeAgent的知识目标自适应动态评估框架，该框架采用了一种新的模拟面试的评估范式。JudgeAgent包括基准评分、交互扩展和评估反馈三个组成部分，并利用了知识驱动的数据综合和目标自适应难度调节方法来进行扩展测试。

**Result:** JudgeAgent提供了准确且有效的评估结果，证明了其在评估大型语言模型时的有效性。通过广泛实验验证了我们提出的评估方法的有效性。

**Conclusion:** JudgeAgent作为一种新的评估框架，能够更准确地评估大型语言模型的能力边界和知识范围，解决了现有评估中的多项挑战，并通过实验展示了其有效性。

**Abstract:** Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential
step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The
current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them
with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers
controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited
interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in
verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely
determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address
these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic
evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm.
JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark
grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes
knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment
methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective
evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating
evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its
dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的方法在处理多模态文档时存在局限性：一类方法依赖布局分析和文本提取，只能利用显式的文本信息，难以捕捉图像或非结构化内容；另一类方法将文档分割视为视觉输入，直接传递给视觉语言模型（VLM）进行处理，但忽略了文本的语义优势，导致生成结果不佳。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种基于共模态的检索增强生成方法（CMRAG），该方法可以同时利用文本和图像进行有效的检索和生成。具体来说，我们首先对文档进行结构化解析，以获得文本片段和图像区域的共模态表示。然后，针对用户的查询，我们分别从文本和图像渠道检索候选证据，并在多模态检索水平上汇总结果。最后，我们提示视觉语言模型根据共模态检索结果生成最终响应。

**Result:** 实验表明，我们的方法在视觉文档问答任务中显著优于纯视觉方法的RAG。

**Conclusion:** 该研究显示，将共模态信息统一整合到RAG框架中是改善复杂文档视觉问答系统性能的有效方法。

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document
question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when
dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout
analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information
and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category
treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual
language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages
of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes
co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and
images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform
structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text
segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we
retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and
aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt
the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval
results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings
of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG
framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the
performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

**Motivation:** 现有的大部分偏见缓解策略是以西方为中心的，未能解决印度特定的种姓与宗教偏见问题。因此，研究需要提出更加适合当地文化特性的解决方案。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为AMBEDKAR的框架，该框架受到印度宪法之父B.R. Ambedkar的平等愿景的启发，旨在引导语言模型的输出更加公平、中立和包容。这一方法引入了一个宪法意识解码层，基于印度的AI宪法，在推理阶段对模型输出进行指导，而不对基础模型进行参数更新。还提出了一种推测解码算法来主动减少与种姓和宗教有关的偏见。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，通过使用AMBEDKAR框架，可以有效降低语言模型输出中的偏见，特别是针对种姓和宗教偏见的缓解。

**Conclusion:** 提出的框架显著减少了偏见，绝对降低高达26.41%，并且不需要对基础模型进行重新训练，降低了计算和基础设施的成本。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases
present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In
the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal
that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most
existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these
local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian
vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM
outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to
17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the
AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any
parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding
algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during
generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding
process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and
infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative
decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In
this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased
generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as
the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust
trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a
fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of
bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and
results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

**Motivation:** 解决在资源有限的语言中进行命名实体识别（NER）的问题，对比使用非常大的多语言语言模型进行微调的方法，探索是否小型模型能在内存或延迟受限的环境下快速适应新语言。

**Method:** 通过将自回归目标的一部分替换为了一阶模型不可知元学习（MAML），研究小型解码器语言模型是否可以在零样本情况下快速适应并转移到未在预训练中见过的语言中。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，MAML在零样本条件下提升了2-6个点的微F1分数，并且减少了8%的收敛时间。特别是对于与Tagalog案粒子si/ni共同出现的单个token人名实体效果更为显著。

**Conclusion:** 小型解码器语言模型在结合MAML之后，可以在零样本条件下有效提升低资源语言NER任务的表现，并加速收敛过程，这对于资源受限环境下的语言处理提供了一个有效的解决思路。

**Abstract:** Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled
by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible
in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs
can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to
languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the
autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML).
Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in
their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed.
Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp
under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence
time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that
co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of
surface anchors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决大型语言模型在故事生成等任务中，由于创意多样性有限而导致重复和单调的输出问题。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为Avoidance Decoding的新解码策略，通过惩罚与先前生成输出的相似性来修改词元logits，从而鼓励更多样化的多分支故事生成。该策略根据两个相似度衡量标准自适应平衡：1）优先在早期阶段使用概念级相似性惩罚，以多样化初始故事概念；2）随着过程推进，越来越多地强调叙述级相似性惩罚，以确保自然且多样化的情节发展。

**Result:** 该方法相比强大的基线，输出多样性提高了多达2.6倍，重复减少了平均30%，同时有效缓解了文本退化现象。

**Conclusion:** 该研究证明了Avoidance Decoding能够有效提高大型语言模型生成内容的多样性和创意性，激活了模型中更广泛的神经元。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous
outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative
diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token
logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby
encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances
two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is
prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2)
Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to
ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to
2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30%
compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration.
Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons,
demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

**Motivation:** 为了应对大型语言模型在处理专业化领域时面临的挑战，特别是关键性问题的真实性评价，以及可靠事实检查工具和数据来源的重要性，本文提出了一个解决方案。

**Method:** 我们通过提供一个涵盖四个生成任务和六个最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）的综合性事实检查基准FActBench来解决这些问题，主要关注医疗领域。我们使用了两种最先进的事实检查技术： Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 促进和自然语言推理（NLI）。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，两种技术通过一致投票获得的事实检查分数与领域专家评估的相关性最好。

**Conclusion:** 这表明一致性投票的事实检查方法能有效反映领域专家的专业评估，可用于改善大型语言模型在医疗领域的准确性。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models tend to struggle when dealing with specialized domains.
While all aspects of evaluation hold importance, factuality is the most
critical one. Similarly, reliable fact-checking tools and data sources are
essential for hallucination mitigation. We address these issues by providing a
comprehensive Fact-checking Benchmark FActBench covering four generation tasks
and six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for the Medical domain.
We use two state-of-the-art Fact-checking techniques: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
Prompting and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our experiments show that the
fact-checking scores acquired through the Unanimous Voting of both techniques
correlate best with Domain Expert Evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型虽有语言能力突出的优点，但也面临幻觉、偏见、隐私问题和高计算成本等挑战。这些问题主要源于单一模型中语言能力和事实记忆的结合。

**Method:** 分析采用不同参数规模（从1.35亿到320亿）的模型，评估它们在语言能力、外部事实知识和内部事实知识三个维度上的表现。

**Result:** 研究发现，随模型规模增加，语言能力和事实知识均有所提高，但内部事实知识增长更快，表明模型大小与记忆的关系比与核心语言能力更紧密。

**Conclusion:** 这些结果支持了语言模型的模块化方法，即使用紧凑的、语言能力强的模型作为工具增强系统的基石。FLM范式为更有效、更可解释和更可持续的NLP解决方案提供了方向。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from
well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and
high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of
linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic
model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language
Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent
models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models
ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic
competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our
findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge
improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster,
suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core
language ability. These results support a modular approach to language
modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the
foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward
more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

<details>

**Motivation:** 研究动机是探讨大语言模型不仅能够推断人类心态，还能揭示团队对话中的盲点，如团队成员理解上的差异。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种新颖的两步框架，该框架利用大语言模型（LLMs）作为人类风格的注释器，用于追踪团队共享的心理模型（SMMs），同时作为自动化差异检测器，识别个体心理状态之间的差异。第一步中，LLM根据任务导向对话生成注释，这些对话来源于合作远程搜索任务（CReST）语料库。第二步，另一个LLM比较这两个注释集合和金标准标签，以检测和描述分歧。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，尽管LLM在简单的自然语言标注任务中表现出明显的连贯性，但在需要空间推理或解析韵律线索的场景中，它们会系统性地出错。

**Conclusion:** 本研究创建了一个SMM连贯性评估框架，应用于六个CReST对话，产生了人类与LLM注释的数据集，连同SMM连贯性的可重复评估框架和基于LLM差异检测的实证评估。

**Abstract:** What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also
expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team
members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team
dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated
discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an
LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented
dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a
secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations
against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define
an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six
CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM
annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3)
an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal
that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward
natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios
requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome the zero gradient issue in current RLVR approaches like GRPO which can lead to ineffective learning due to fixed clipping bounds and standardization of identical rewards.

**Method:** DCPO introduces a dynamic clipping strategy and a smooth advantage standardization technique to enhance both token-level exploration and the effective use of generated responses.

**Result:** DCPO showed state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, outperforming GRPO and DAPO in performance metrics and training efficiency, achieving significant improvements in the nonzero advantage and token clipping ratio.

**Conclusion:** DCPO effectively improves the performance of RLVR in large language models by optimizing gradients and improving the utilization of generated data, leading to better outcomes on various benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero
gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for
token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards,
which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of
generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy
Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that
adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior
probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage
standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training
steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated
responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based
on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under
greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24
benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the
Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO
achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO
(20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the
nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency
over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of
magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance.
These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more
efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

**Method:** 该论文通过分析和归纳现有的研究方法，提出了一个以执行范式为中心的分类法，将现有方法分为三类：基于潜在优化的方法、基于信号控制的方法、基于层次递归的方法。

**Result:** 该研究提出了隐式推理在LLMs内部执行的三种范式，并提供了评估这些推理有效性的评价指标和基准。

**Conclusion:** 通过引入新的分类法，该研究深化了我们对LLMs内部隐式推理机制的理解，为该领域未来的深入研究提供了结构化框架和参考基准。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a
wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step
problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent
studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward
implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures
without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings
advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better
alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed
latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and
mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs
remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered
on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to
computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution
paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation
unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent
execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based
evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further
provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in
existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit
reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Despite the demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies underexploit this potential because they lack temporally grounded fine-grained annotations. This paper aims to close that gap.

**Method:** Our approach integrates well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative large language model (LLM) annotation pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt engineering. The method involves defining three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion mining literature, which serve as schemas for structured representation.

**Result:** The authors perform rigorous quantitative evaluation of their pipeline using human-annotated test samples and compute inter-annotator agreement across the fine-grained opinion dimensions. They use two separate LLMs for the final annotations, and the result is a knowledge base that encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions.

**Conclusion:** The final knowledge base is compatible with applications such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), temporal question answering, and timeline summarisation, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in creating a comprehensive temporal opinion analysis framework.

**Abstract:** Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing
patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely.
Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms,
creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease
classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along
with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities
in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic
medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
(CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a
majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and
preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best
classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging
various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding
of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth
data.

**Motivation:** 现有的人格检测方法严重依赖大规模标注数据集，难以获得高质量的人格标签，并且大多数研究忽略了情绪和人格之间的互动。因此，本文提出了EmoPerso框架来提高通过情绪感知建模的人格检测质量。

**Method:** EmoPerso采用了一种自我监督框架，首先利用生成机制进行合成数据增强和丰富表示学习，然后通过多任务学习提取伪标记的情感特征并与人格预测联合优化。此外，它采用了一个交叉注意力模块来捕获人格特质和推断出的情感表示之间的交互，并以自我训练策略来迭代提高模型的推理能力。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，EmoPerso在两个基准数据集上的表现超过了现有最先进的模型。

**Conclusion:** 本文提出的情感感知建模方法EmoPerso能够有效地提升人格检测的准确性，并且该方法优于现有的最先进的模型。

**Abstract:** Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users'
social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality
labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent
variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection
through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms
for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then
extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with
personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is
employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and
the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning,
EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning
capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 探讨大型语言模型是否真的纳入外部定义，还是主要依赖其参数化知识。

**Method:** 通过在多个解释基准数据集（包括通用和特定领域）上进行控制实验，以及标记定义条件（包括由专家整理、LLM生成、扰动和交换定义）来研究问题。

**Result:** 研究结果显示，尽管明确的标签定义可以提高准确性和可解释性，但它们在LLM任务解决过程中的集成既不确定也不一致，表明在许多情况下LLM主要依赖于其内在表示。模型在通用任务中经常默认使用其内部表示，而在特定领域任务中更受益于明确的定义。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现强调了需要进一步理解LLM如何处理外部知识以及其现有能力之间的关系。

**Abstract:** Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely
on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct
controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general
and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated,
LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that
while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their
integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor
consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.
Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general
tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.
These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs
process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

**Motivation:** 尽管各供应商已经发布了详细的安全约束和定性特征的行为规范，但还没有系统的审计来检测模型是否确实符合这些规范。本研究旨在解决这一问题。

**Method:** 引入了一个自动化的框架，通过解析行为声明、生成针对性的提示，并使用模型来判断模型输出是否符合供应商的行为规范。该方法关注三点一致性：供应商规范、模型输出以及模型本身作为判断者之间的一致性。这超越了之前的两阶段生成器-验证器一致性。

**Result:** 对来自六个开发者的16个模型超过100个行为声明进行审计，发现系统性的不一致，合规差距最高达到20%。

**Conclusion:** 该研究建立了一个必需的基础，即一个基础模型至少应该在开发者自评模型的判断下的行为规范满足一致性。但在目前，许多供应商的模型并未达到这个标准。

**Abstract:** Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they
pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do
so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published
detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and
qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of
adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits
models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements,
generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central
focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model
outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator
validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a
foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral
specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our
framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral
statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up
to 20 percent across providers.

**Motivation:** 尽管奖励建模在过去几年取得了显著进展，但构建有效奖励模型仍然依赖大量的标注偏好数据，这仍然是一个基本挑战。本研究旨在通过提出改进的方法来解决这一问题。

**Conclusion:** 本研究成功展示了GRAM-R$^2$作为一种基础模型在奖励推理方面的潜力，它不仅能够支持响应排名等任务，而且可以最小化额外微调的需求，对于未来的研究和应用具有重要意义。

**Abstract:** Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by
a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models.
Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental
challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data.
Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but
existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward
models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages
unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this
approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce
not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$
can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a
wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support
downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward
tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement
learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers
strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative
baselines.

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型的快速发展引发了公众对其潜在滥用的担忧，因此构建可信赖的AI生成文本检测系统变得重要。现有方法忽视了风格建模，主要依赖静态阈值，极大地限制了检测性能。

**Method:** 本文提出了Mixture of Stylistic Experts (MoSEs)框架，通过条件阈值估计进行风格感知的不确定性量化。MoSEs包含三个核心组件：风格参考库（SRR）、风格感知路由器（SAR）和条件阈值估计器（CTE）。SRR激活合适的参考数据并传递给CTE。CTE联合语言统计特性和语义特征动态确定最优阈值。

**Result:** MoSEs实现了11.34%的检测性能提升，特别是在低资源情况下，提高了39.15%。

**Conclusion:** MoSEs框架能够显著改善AI生成文本的检测性能，尤其是在资源有限的情况下。代码公开以供进一步研究。

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public
concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build
trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect
stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits
the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic
Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty
quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three
core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the
Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE).
For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and
provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic
statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the
optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels
with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average
improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More
inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource
case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in
NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource
settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack
of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten
low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada,
Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000
news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically
similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to
test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the
correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We
benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and
language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that
multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models
vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a
valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such
applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice
question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations
of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP. The dataset is shared

**Result:** 该研究展示了AI如何重新激活皮奇在1931年发明的国际密钥和意符系统，以在任何罗曼语之间进行翻译（至少作为一个初步步骤）。研究方法是让AI重新翻译皮奇曾在1931年翻译过的两篇文本摘录：但丁《新生》的一段内容从意大利语翻译成法语，和伏尔泰《萨底格》的一段内容从法语翻译成意大利语。结果显示，94年后使用同一方法翻译的两篇文本之间只有小幅差异。在验证了皮奇系统的可行性后，AI进一步使用该方法将摘录翻译成英语、西班牙语和德语，结果一致。通过AI，皮奇被赋予了翻译更现代和技术化文本的能力，重新燃起了一个基本上未知且从未被广泛应用的发明，并将其置于可能的实验和讨论中。这一实验不仅证实了皮奇的历史地位，也将他置于机器翻译的先驱和贡献者之列，与Troyanskij、Booth和Weaver等人一同受到审视，可能会影响对该领域历史的理解。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果不仅证实了皮奇所提出的基于规则的翻译系统在现代人工智能技术下的可行性，也恢复了他的历史重要性，以及他在机器翻译历史上的地位与贡献。

**Abstract:** A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern
RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci,
who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico
ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria
lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI
breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised
by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first
step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's
method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly
documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated
from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from
French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years
apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low
average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system
thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in
English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were
consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating
more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an
invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond
its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible
experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical
status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to
machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as
Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history
of the field is understood.

> 本文提出了top-H解码方法，改进了大型语言模型在文本生成中平衡创造力和连贯性的问题。实验结果显示，与min-$p$采样方法相比，top-H在创意写作基准测试中提升了高达25.63%的性能，同时在问题回答数据集上保持了稳定性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现存的截断采样技术，如温度缩放、top-
$p$采样和min-
$p$采样，在平衡创造力和连贯性方面存在不足，尤其是未能有效利用模型的置信度。

**Method:** 本文利用一个熵约束下的最小化差异问题，通过证明其与熵约束质量最大化问题（ECMM）的等价性，引入了top-H解码，这是一种解决ECMM问题的计算上高效的贪心算法。

**Result:** 实验表明，top-H解码在创意写作基准测试中比最先进的min-
$p$采样方法性能提升高达25.63%，同时在GPQA、GSM8K和MT-Bench等问题回答数据集上保持了稳定性。

**Conclusion:** top-H解码推进了大型语言模型在开放式文本生成中的最先进水平，并可轻松集成到创意写作应用程序中。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a
wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in
open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving
logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including
temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim
to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in
the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the
corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a
single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the
information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of
the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We
first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity
and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained
minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be
equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,
which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally
efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)
alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing
benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as
GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms
that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where
creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in
open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing
applications. The code is available at
https://github.com/ErfanBaghaei/Top-H-Decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 此研究旨在探讨针对代码混合文本（如Hinglish）的命名实体识别任务中，专用模型与通用模型之间的有效性差异，特别是在模型预训练阶段的特定领域处理能力。

**Method:** 研究比较了针对代码混合数据训练的模型（如HingBERT, HingMBERT, HingRoBERTa）和非代码混合多语言模型（如BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa, MuRIL）在Hinglish（印地语-英语混合）命名实体识别任务中的表现。此外，研究还评估了在零样本设置下闭源大语言模型Google Gemini的性能。

**Result:** 结果显示，针对代码混合数据训练的模型，尤其是HingRoBERTa和HingBERT表现最佳，超过了包括Google Gemini在内的其他模型。非代码混合模型表现尚可但适应性有限。Google Gemini虽然为零样本模型，表现仍然具有竞争力，表明现代大语言模型的泛化能力。

**Conclusion:** 研究结论表明，对于代码混合命名实体识别任务，专门针对特定代码混合数据训练的模型更为有效，而非代码混合多语言模型虽有一定表现但受限于适应性。这项研究为针对特定任务优化的语言模型设计提供了关键洞察。

**Abstract:** Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English
(Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure,
transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a
comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed
multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained
on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained
on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google
Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER
tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using
Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,
particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform
others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to
domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show
limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot
performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study
provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized
models for code-mixed NER tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决现有RLVR方法由于稀疏奖励信号和不稳定的策略梯度更新而面临的一大挑战。特别是基于RL的方法在这些挑战下表现不佳。

**Method:** 提出了一种新的RLVR框架PACS，该框架通过监督学习框架实现隐式的Actor-Critic耦合。通过将结果奖励视为可预测的标签，将RLVR问题重新表述为一个监督学习任务，从而改革了基于趋势的更新方式。

**Result:** 在具有挑战性的数学推理任务基准测试中，PACS在AIME 2025上实现了256 pass@级别的59.78%，分别比PPO和GRPO提高了13.32和14.36个百分点，优于强基线。

**Conclusion:** 这个框架为带可验证奖励的LLMs后训练提供了一条有潜力的道路。

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have
empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks
such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards
to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output
quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR
paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from
sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in
RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a
novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor
$\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By
treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR
problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by
the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient
analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the
classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic
roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging
mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as
PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS
achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32
and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a
promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and
data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.

**Motivation:** 挑战主流观点，探讨小模型在特定语言下的性能表现，旨在为资源匮乏的语言提供更好的自动语音识别支持。

**Method:** 研究针对几种小众语言，训练了27M参数的单语模型，使用了高质量标注、伪标注及合成数据。

**Result:** 研究表明，通过在精心平衡的高质量人工标注、伪标注和合成数据上训练单语系统，即使是小模型（27M参数）也能优于多语种模型。该方法在几种语言上显著降低错误率，优于参数更多的模型，并发布多个语言模型。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果推进了此类大小模型的最先进水平，允许为之前支持有限的语言提供准确的设备端自动语音识别能力。

**Abstract:** We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages.
Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual
counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge
this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters),
training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality
human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior
performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the
comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small
model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium
model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size,
enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited
support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

> DARLING optimizes LMs for quality and diversity via reinforcement learning, enhancing performance in both creative and verifiable tasks by improving exploratory capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitation in post-training of LMs which enhances accuracy but reduces output diversity, impacting their effectiveness in creative and exploratory tasks.

**Method:** DARLING, a framework that optimizes for both response quality and semantic diversity by introducing a learned partition function and combining it with a quality reward during reinforcement learning.

**Result:** DARLING outperforms quality-only RL baselines in both non-verifiable tasks and verifiable tasks, showing higher quality and novelty in outputs.

**Conclusion:** Explicitly optimizing for diversity improves the exploration in reinforcement learning which leads to better quality responses, enhancing the performance of LMs in diverse tasks.

**Abstract:** Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and
helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while
post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions
and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and
exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We
address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a
framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.
At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure
diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is
then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,
encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.
Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING
generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and
creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks
in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL
baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and
novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution
quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing
for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as
higher-quality responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于大型语言模型在预训练阶段接触到的数据主要源自互联网，其内容往往偏向于高资源语言和文化，从而导致这些模型在理解其他特定文化方面存在不足。本文的动机在于通过PalmX 2025任务来填补大型语言模型在这方面的知识差距。

**Method:** 本文介绍了PalmX 2025，这是一个旨在评估大型语言模型在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化相关领域文化能力的共享任务。任务分为两个子任务：普通阿拉伯文化和普通伊斯兰文化，这些子任务包含多选题，涵盖了从中东22个国家的传统、食物、历史、宗教实践和语言表达等方面。

**Result:** 共有26支团队注册了子任务1，19支团队注册了子任务2，最终分别有9和6支队伍成功提交了有效结果。研究表明任务特定的微调可以大大提高模型的baseline表现，最佳系统可以在文化问题上达到72.15%的准确率，在伊斯兰知识上达到84.22%的准确率，同时参数高效的微调被认为是最为主流和有效的方法，而数据增强的方法效果则在不同领域中各具特色。

**Conclusion:** 这项研究通过设计特定的文化基准任务PalmX 2025，评估了大型语言模型在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化领域的能力，并揭示了任务特定微调和参数高效的微调方法在提升性能上的显著效果。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions
they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly
sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards
high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,
LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap
that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.
This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented
topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first
shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these
specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General
Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range
of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and
language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew
considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for
Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our
findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance
over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15%
on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among
participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be
domain-dependent.

**Motivation:** 由于大规模视觉语言预训练模型的广泛采用图像文本检索任务的成功，但它们在移动设备上的部署受到模型尺寸大和计算复杂度的影响。我们提出了一种新颖的框架——自适应多模态多教师知识蒸馏（AMMKD），该框架集成了多模态特征融合、多教师知识蒸馏和自适应优化，以提供轻量化且有效的检索模型。

**Method:** 我们的方法从一个多模态特征融合网络开始，该网络从图像和文本模态中提取并融合判别特征。为了减少模型参数并进一步提高性能，我们设计了一个多教师知识蒸馏框架来预训练两个CLIP教师模型。我们将模态性分离，通过教师文本编码器预先计算并存储文本特征作为类向量以提高效率。为了更好地对齐教师和学生输出，我们应用了KL散度匹配概率分布。最后，我们设计了一个自适应动态加权方案，将多教师蒸馏视为一个多目标优化问题。通过利用梯度空间多样性，我们动态调整每个教师的影响，减少冲突，引导学生朝更优的学习方向迈进。

**Result:** 广泛的实验表明，AMMKD不仅在三个基准数据集上实现了优秀的性能，而且还显著降低了模型复杂性，验证了其有效性和灵活性。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，AMMKD能够实现在降低模型复杂性的同时提高模型性能，证明了其在移动设备部署上的有效性和灵活性。

**Abstract:** The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the environmental issue caused by the high carbon emissions from deep learning model training and to bridge the gap between green AI theories and their practical application.

**Method:** This paper proposes a two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system for deep learning models, introducing the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) and the area under the sustainability curve (ASC) as new quantitative indicators to balance performance and energy consumption.

**Result:** The experiments in various multimodal tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the proposed sustainability evaluation system.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the introduced sustainability evaluation framework not only offers a method to quantitatively assess algorithms across different tasks but also advances the practical implementation of green AI research by providing a foundation for industry standards.

**Abstract:** This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

Main category: cs.CV

> Scaffold Diffusion, a discrete diffusion language model, generates realistic 3D voxel structures in sparse multi-category settings, effectively handling cubic memory scaling and class imbalance issues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The cubic memory scaling and class imbalance due to sparsity pose challenges in generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures.

**Method:** Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures by treating voxels as tokens, extending its application from sequential domains like text to spatially coherent 3D structures.

**Result:** Compared to previous methods, Scaffold Diffusion produces realistically coherent structures even when trained on highly sparse data, demonstrated using Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset.

**Conclusion:** Discrete diffusion represents a promising approach for generating realistic 3D sparse voxel structures, as highlighted by the success of Scaffold Diffusion.

**Abstract:** Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

> 提出了一种新的SGLC框架，解决高分辨率图像去雾问题，通过结合全局和局部特征，增强去雾效果，提升图像的视觉保真度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管当代去雾模型展示了优秀的性能，但很少有研究关注高分辨率图像去雾。在处理高分辨率图像时，从业者通常会降低输入图像的分辨率或分块处理，这导致了性能下降，主要是因为难以将全局上下文信息与局部细节有效地结合起来。为了解决这一问题，提出了SGLC框架。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为流线型全局和局部特征组合器（SGLC）的新型框架，解决高分辨率图像去雾的问题。该方法包含两个主要部分：全局特征生成器（GFG）和局部特征增强器（LFE）。GFG通过关注场景的广泛上下文理解来生成初步的去雾输出，而LFE则通过增强局部细节和像素级特征来进一步优化，以捕获全局外观和局部结构之间的相互作用。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，SGLC框架在处理高分辨率数据集时显著提高了峰值信噪比（PSNR）。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果证实了SGLC设计的功效，并且该设计为模型不可知论，这意味着任何去雾网络都可以被增强，从而利用场景级线索和粒度细节，显著改善高分辨率环境中的视觉保真度。

**Abstract:** Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 肾脏异常检测在所有临床前药物开发中是必需的，然而，它涉及数百到数千张全幻灯片图像的耗时且昂贵的检查，其中大多数图像实际上是正常的。本研究旨在通过机器学习方法，特别是自我监督学习，自动化该过程，以降低成本和时间。

**Method:** 本研究提出了第一个大规模的自我监督异常检测模型，用于肾脏毒理病理学，涵盖了158种化合物的安全性评估研究。初步使用从UNI基础模型（FM）提取的特征，并尝试简单的k最近邻分类器，结果表明这些特征不足以检测异常。接着，将自我监督方法应用于相同特征，获得了优于随机性能的结果，曲线下面积为0.62，阴性预测值为89%。

**Result:** 初步尝试使用基础模型的特征并结合k最近邻分类器，结果表明其不足以检测肾脏异常。然而，应用自我监督方法后，实现了优于随机水平的性能，其曲线下面积为0.62，阴性预测值为89%。

**Conclusion:** 鉴于研究结果，此类模型有望用于药物安全性评估中的正常幻灯片排除，这有望大大降低成本和耗时。

**Abstract:** Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

> The paper presents a method for text-to-image retrieval that uses a generative diffusion model and vision model to bridge the modality gap, outperforming methods that rely solely on text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this work is to improve the performance of text-to-image retrieval by addressing the limitation of vision-and-language models (VLMs) that map text and images to distant regions in the representation space, thus limiting retrieval performance.

**Method:** This paper proposes a two-step approach for text-to-image retrieval. The first step is to transform the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. The second step is to estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. An aggregation network is also introduced to combine multiple images into a single vector representation and to fuse similarity scores across both query modalities.

**Result:** Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better performance compared to retrieval methods that solely depend on text queries.

**Conclusion:** The approach introduced in this paper leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and text-to-image generation models, showing consistent improvement over text-only retrieval methods.

**Abstract:** This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 多模态大语言模型已在视觉-语言任务上展示了显著的能力，但这些模型往往会在不明确请求的情况下推测和揭示敏感的生物特征信息，如种族、性别、年龄、体重和眼睛颜色，这在实际应用，特别是在社会敏感领域中，引起了关键的关注。然而，当前没有公开可用的数据集或基准来全面评估或减轻多模态大语言模型中的生物特征信息泄露。

**Method:** 介绍了一种新的基准PRISM，用于评估多模态大语言模型在拒绝生物特征相关的查询和一般响应中的隐性生物特征泄露的同时保持语义忠实度的能力。同时，对广泛使用的LLaVA数据集进行了详细审查，并发现了广泛的生物特征泄露，进而提出了Safe-LLaVA数据集，这是通过系统删除LLaVA数据集中的明确和隐性生物特征信息而构建的第一个隐私保护的多模态大语言模型训练数据集。

**Result:** 评估表明，不同属性的生物特征泄露普遍存在，突出了详细的隐私侵犯。同时，通过对Safe-LLaVA数据集进行微调，显示出其显著减少了生物特征泄漏的数量，为隐私对齐的多模态大语言模型的发展和评估设定了新标准。

**Conclusion:** Safe-LLaVA数据集和PRISM基准的推出，为改进多模态大语言模型的隐私对齐开发和评估设定了新的标准。这些资源的公开共享，有助于推动多模态大语言模型的隐私保护研究与实践发展。

**Abstract:** Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark

**Motivation:** To enhance deep learning models in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to dynamic environments for complex tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question answering, addressing the limitations of existing vision-language models.

**Method:** VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method integrating three key components: 1) a cross-modal alignment framework combining objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues, 2) a dynamic, implicit cognitive map enabled by world embedding, and 3) an instruction-based navigation and reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning.

**Result:** Demonstrated improvements of 1%-3% in accuracy and exploration efficiency on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE compared to traditional methods.

**Conclusion:** VEME significantly improves reasoning and planning capabilities in dynamic environments, achieving better generalization in unseen scenes.

**Abstract:** Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

**Motivation:** 间叶瘤是一种罕见的乳腺纤维上皮病变，由于放射学上类似于良性纤维腺瘤，术前分类困难，这常常导致不必要的外科切除。因此，本研究旨在通过开发创新的诊断方法来改善这一情况。

**Conclusion:** 本研究证明，多模态AI有潜力作为一种非侵入性诊断工具，减少不必要的活检，改善乳腺肿瘤的管理决策。

**Abstract:** Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

**Motivation:** 该研究旨在解决快速霍夫变换算法在任意大小图像上精度下降的问题，以及精确算法计算成本高的问题。

**Method:** FHT2SP算法建立在Brady的超像素概念基础上，将其扩展到任意形状，而不仅仅是原始的2的幂次方大小的正方形，并将其整合到FHT2DT算法中。

**Result:** 通过适当选择超像素的大小，FHT2SP算法能够实现近似最优的计算复杂度$\mathcal{O}(wh\ln^3 w)$，同时将近似误差控制在与图像大小无关的常数范围内。

**Conclusion:** 理论和实验分析表明，FHT2SP算法不仅计算复杂度接近最优，而且可以保持常数范围内的误差，有效平衡了精度和成本。

**Abstract:** The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates the potential of vision-language model-guided generative workflows to enhance industrial computer vision systems, moving beyond the constraints of traditional pipelines.

**Abstract:** Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in

into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge

**Abstract:** Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

### [156] [Towards Adaptive Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00320)
*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Chenrui He,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

> 研究分析了视觉和文本令牌之间的冗余差异，并提出了一种新的视觉令牌修剪策略，在保持跨模态对齐和模态内部信息多样性的同时，大幅减少了令牌数量和计算成本。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 视觉和文本令牌之间的冗余差异导致计算和内存成本增加，传统的令牌修剪方法依赖于昂贵的校准或次优的重要性指标，导致保留了冗余令牌。

**Method:** 提出了一种基于互信息的视觉令牌修剪策略，该策略通过剔除与文本令牌语义不一致的视觉令牌，并通过最大化嵌入空间中保留令牌的预期成对距离来进一步修剪冗余视觉令牌，从而有效保持视觉和文本模态之间的对齐。

**Result:** 实验表明，该方法能够在减少令牌数量至88.9%的同时保持性能，在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NEXT-7B等模型上推理速度提高了56.7%。

**Conclusion:** 提出的方法可以有效提高模型推理效率，同时减少计算和内存成本，未来可能在大型多模态模型中得到广泛应用。

**Abstract:** Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

**Abstract:** Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

**Motivation:** 当前红外与可见光图像融合的研究主要集中在提高融合效果，但往往忽视了在实际应用中的实时性需求。

**Method:** 采用蒸馏学习可学习查找表(LUT)的方法来实现多模态图像的快速融合，提出了效率更高的LUT蒸馏策略。

**Result:** 该论文通过提出一种名为LUT-Fuse的新型方法实现了极快的融合过程，这种方法主要利用可学习查找表进行蒸馏。方法包括开发使用低阶近似编码和高层联合场景编码的查找表结构，这特别适合多模态融合。此外，由于多模态图像融合中缺乏真实数据，他们提出了一种高效的LUT蒸馏策略，这种方法比传统的量化LUT方法更有效。通过将多模态融合网络（MM-Net）的性能整合进MM-LUT模型，该方法显著提高了效率和性能，比当前最轻量级的SOTA融合算法快十倍以上，满足了实时处理的需求，即使在低功耗移动设备上也能确保高运行速度。实验数据验证了该融合方法的优势、可靠性和稳定性。

**Conclusion:** 该方法在效率和性能上均取得了显著突破，相比当前最轻量级的SOTA融合算法，其处理时间只需不到十分之一，适用于各类场景，包括低功耗移动设备上。

**Abstract:** Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

**Conclusion:** 此项工作建立了一种新思路，认为最小的文本元数据可以作为实际和经常被忽视的资源，以增强在严苛数据约束下模型的泛化能力，开启了在目标部署环境中使用鲁棒模型的新途径。

**Abstract:** Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 空气质量监测在资源受限的地区依然具有挑战性，这主要是因为传感器部署稀疏且基础设施有限。针对这一问题，本文旨在提供一种适用于这些地区空气质量指数预测的有效解决方案。

**Method:** 该论文提出了AQFusionNet框架，这是一个用于空气质量指数（AQI）预测的多模态深度学习框架。框架整合了地面大气图像与污染物浓度数据，使用轻量级的CNN骨架（如MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNet-B0）进行处理。视觉和传感器特征通过语义对齐的嵌入空间相结合，从而实现准确且高效的预测。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，在印度和尼泊尔的8000多个样本上，AQFusionNet显著优于单模态基线方法，使用EfficientNet-B0作为骨架时，分类准确率可达92.02%，均方根误差为7.70。模型相比单模态方法提高了18.5%的性能表现，同时保持了低计算负载，适合在边缘设备上部署。

**Conclusion:** AQFusionNet为基础设施不足环境中的AQI监测提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案，即使在部分传感器可用的情况下也具备强大的预测能力。

**Abstract:** Air pollution monitoring in resource-constrained regions remains challenging
due to sparse sensor deployment and limited infrastructure. This work
introduces AQFusionNet, a multimodal deep learning framework for robust Air
Quality Index (AQI) prediction. The framework integrates ground-level
atmospheric imagery with pollutant concentration data using lightweight CNN
backbones (MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNet-B0). Visual and sensor features

Nepal demonstrate that AQFusionNet consistently outperforms unimodal baselines,
achieving up to 92.02% classification accuracy and an RMSE of 7.70 with the
EfficientNet-B0 backbone. The model delivers an 18.5% improvement over

*Jin Ye,Fengchao Xiong,Jun Zhou,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

> 本文提出了一种迭代低秩网络（ILRNet），该网络结合了模型驱动和数据驱动方法的优点，通过采用秩最小化模块（RMM）并且自适应地迭代细化过程，实现了HSI的去噪与图像细节的保留，结果表明该方法在噪声去除任务中达到了最先进的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** HSI去噪是后续任务的重要预处理步骤。干净的HSI通常位于低维子空间内，可以通过低秩和稀疏表示来捕捉，这被认作是HSI的物理先验。然而，充分利用这些物理特性进行有效去噪同时保留图像细节通常是具有挑战性的。

**Method:** ILRNet整合了模型驱动和数据驱动方法的优点，通过在U-Net架构中嵌入秩最小化模块（RMM），该模块在前向传播中将特征图转换到小波域并对低频分量应用奇异值阈值化（SVT），以利用HSI在特征域中的光谱低秩性。RMM中的参数与奇异向量阈值算法的超参数紧密相关，并可以自适应地从数据中学习，从而灵活有效地捕捉不同场景下的低秩性。此外，ILRNet还具有迭代细化过程，可以自适应地结合各阶段去噪HSI与噪声输入，确保逐步增强并更好地保留图像细节。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，ILRNet在合成和真实世界噪声去除任务中均达到了最先进的性能。

**Conclusion:** ILRNet通过集成物理先验并利用迭代细化机制，在保持图像细节的同时实现了HSI的有效去噪，展示了其在噪声去除任务中优越的性能。

**Abstract:** Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

**Motivation:** 已有研究在外科手术视频理解方面取得了显著进展，但仍存在两个重大局限性，包括视觉内容感知不足和手术视频时间意识不足，从而阻碍了多种计算机辅助手术（CAS）解决方案的发展。

**Method:** 提出SurgLLM框架，一个专为多样的外科手术视频理解任务设计的有效大型多模态模型，该模型增强了空间关注点和时间意识。首先，通过进行以手术器械为中心的遮罩视频重建（MV-Recon）和随后的多模态对齐，提出外科手术情境感知多模态预训练（Surg-Pretrain）来增强外科手术视频的空间关注点。为了将手术时间知识融入SurgLLM，进一步提出时间感知多模态调优（TM-Tuning），以增强时序推理。此外，设计了外科手术任务动态集成，能够在SurgLLM中有效地将查询与最优的学习参数进行配对，以适应各种手术视频理解任务。

**Result:** 在多样化的外科手术视频理解任务中，包括视频描述、通用视觉问答和时序视觉问答，进行大量的实验，相较于现有顶级方法，SurgLLM展示出显著的改进，证实了其在多样化的外科手术视频理解中的有效性。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果验证了SurgLLM在多种外科手术视频理解任务上的有效性。开源代码可以在https://github.com/franciszchen/SurgLLM找到。

**Abstract:** Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

**Abstract:** Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

> The paper introduces SPO-VLM, a two-stage defense strategy for enhancing the robustness of Vision Language Models against adversarial attacks without degrading their performance on non-adversarial tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** VLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, prompting the need for a more robust defense method that does not harm performance on benign tasks.

**Method:** Sequence-Level Preference Optimization for VLM (SPO-VLM) is proposed with a two-stage framework. Stage I computes adaptive layer-specific steering vectors, and Stage II refines these through preference optimization, integrating toxicity assessment and visual consistency for safer text generation.

**Result:** Experiments show that SPO-VLM improves safety against attacks while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks and visual understanding capabilities.

**Conclusion:** SPO-VLM effectively balances model robustness and efficiency, significantly enhancing safety against adversarial attacks while preserving high performance on normal tasks.

**Abstract:** Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 我们的动机是解决传统数据增强方法如CutMix在组合多类别图像时常常出现的不自然边界问题，从而生成更自然和高分辨率的图像。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种新的数据增强方法，称为NoiseCutMix。该方法结合了扩散模型的生成能力和CutMix结合两个类别的特征来生成多样化增强数据的特点。NoiseCutMix通过部分结合扩散模型中对应两个不同类别的估计噪声来实现具有两类融合特征的自然、高分辨率图像生成，从而避免了传统方法中由于上下文差异导致的不自然边界问题。

**Result:** 在分类实验中，我们通过与传统多类别数据增强技术（如CutMix和MixUp）、使用Stable Diffusion随机生成图像以及这些方法的组合进行比较，验证了我们提出方法的有效性。

**Conclusion:** 我们的实验结果显示，NoiseCutMix作为一种数据增强方法，能够生成更加自然且具有高分辨率的图像，其效果优于传统方法。该代码在GitHub上可获取。

**Abstract:** In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

**Motivation:** 旨在减少3D激光雷达数据标注带来的高成本和时间投入，利用现成的2D图像数据集进行学习。

**Method:** 提出两种方法：UDAKD和FSKD，利用摄像头和激光雷达数据的时空同步属性，将经过训练的2D图像模型应用于未标注的2D数据中，并通过跨模态知识蒸馏进行学习。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，所提方法在领域内显著超越了现有最佳性能。

**Conclusion:** 通过跨模态知识蒸馏的方法，成功减少了3D LiDAR数据的标注需求，同时保持了高性能的分割结果。

**Abstract:** Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

**Motivation:** 在叙事分析中，将各种形式的数据转换成连贯的手绘叙事在故事形式上带来了沉重的数据分析负担。此外，参与者需要参与成员检查和叙事产品的展示，这涉及审查和对大量文档的回应。为了提高叙事制造和表示的效率以及友好性，本研究提出了这一新方法。

**Conclusion:** NAME方法有效地减轻了叙事分析中的认知负担，并在其稳健性评估机制的辅助下，取得了超越基线的表现。这为研究人员提供了一种新的高效方法来创建和呈现故事。

**Abstract:** Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address significant object appearance variations and partial occlusions caused by frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos.

**Method:** HERO-VQL includes Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) for context and fine-grained localization, and Egocentric Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT) for query diversity and viewpoint change simulation. CT loss stabilizes object localization.

**Result:** HERO-VQL significantly outperforms baselines on the VQ2D dataset.

**Conclusion:** HERO-VQL successfully addresses the challenges of egocentric visual query localization by simulating diverse scenarios and using advanced attention mechanisms.

**Abstract:** In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

> 该研究提出了一种双重约束扩散模型（DCDM），用于超低剂量PET重建，能提高图像质量，适应不同剂量水平，且无需重新训练所有参数。实验结果表明其在已知和未知剂量减少因子（DRF）下均优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 减少患者辐射暴露和缩短检查时间是超低剂量PET重建的重要动机，然而，这也可能导致图像噪声增加和细节损失，因此需要开发新技术来提高图像质量。

**Method:** 研究提出了一种双重约束扩散模型（DCDM），包括一个核变换约束（NTC）模块和一个编码节点约束（ENC）模块，这两个模块用于精细化预训练扩散模型，在低剂量图像中有效提取信息并将其转化为潜空间的压缩特征表示，再通过这一压缩表示来编码控制预训练扩散模型，获得像素空间的重建PET图像。

**Result:** 该研究提出了一种双重约束扩散模型（DCDM），通过固定预训练扩散模型的权重并注入可训练的双重约束控制器到编码架构中，大幅减少了超低剂量PET重建所需的可训练参数量。与全微调模型不同，DCDM能够适应不同的剂量水平而无需重新训练所有模型参数，从而提高了重建的灵活性。通过实验验证了DCDM在已知和未知剂量减少因子（DRF）场景下均优于现有方法，即使在超低剂量水平，如全剂量1%，也表现出色。

**Conclusion:** 双重约束扩散模型（DCDM）在超低剂量PET重建中表现出色，不仅提高了图像质量，而且能够适应不同的剂量水平，无需重新训练所有模型参数，从而提高了重建的灵活性。

**Abstract:** Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

Main category: cs.CV

> A novel deep learning method, Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI), is introduced to effectively remove unwanted objects from omnidirectional videos while addressing the challenges associated with the distortion in equirectangular projection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind the research is to solve the issue of unwanted objects appearing in omnidirectional videos due to their wide field of view, which is not effectively handled by existing video inpainting methods. These existing methods typically do not account for the distortion in equirectangular projection of omnidirectional videos.

**Method:** The paper proposes a method named Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). It features a module for evaluating temporal motion based on geodesic distance in the image space and a depth-aware feature propagation module in the feature space to manage geometric distortions typical in omnidirectional videos.

**Result:** The experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed DAOVI method performs better than current methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that the proposed Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI) model succeeds in providing superior performance in inpainting for omnidirectional videos, both in terms of quantitative and qualitative measures.

**Abstract:** Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

**Motivation:** 最近的方法在捕捉输入中的细粒度动态细节或生成新视点下的可信细节方面存在困难，主要原因是avatar模型的表示能力有限和观测数据不足。为了克服这些挑战，提出了这种方法。

**Method:** 本论文提出了一种新的框架，结合高级视频生成模型Human4DiT来生成从不同视角看的人体动作，用作额外的监督信号。这种方法不仅丰富了以前未见过区域的细节，还有效规范了avatar表示以减少失真。另外，论文提出两种互补策略来增强视频生成：一是通过视频微调将物理身份注入模型以确保人体动作的一致性；二是使用基于补丁的降噪算法来实现更高分辨率的输出和更精细的细节。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，该方法在近期的最先进技术中表现更优，并验证了所提出策略的有效性。

**Conclusion:** 通过提出的方法和策略，成功提高了从单目视频重建人类avatar的质量，为未来的研究提供了有效的手段。

**Abstract:** We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

**Motivation:** 动机在于加速现有的视觉语言模型的推理过程，提高模型的效率和实用性，特别是在处理大型模型时。

**Method:** LightVLM将推理过程分为编码和解码两个阶段，通过金字塔令牌合并减少令牌数量和KV缓存压缩减少缓存，从而提高网络吞吐量和减少推理时间。

**Result:** 实验表明，LightVLM可以保留100%的性能，同时只保持35%的图像标记，甚至仅保持3%的图像标记时，性能仍能保持到大约98%。LightVLM还能显著提升大型模型的推理速度。

**Conclusion:** LightVLM可以显著提高视觉语言模型的推理速度和效率，特别是对于较长时间的序列生成，有望为模型的实际部署带来便利。

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

**Abstract:** Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and

Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space

**Motivation:** 多实例学习（MIL）在计算病理学中用于从整张切片图像（WSIs）中提取判别特征，但基于注意力的MIL方法和Transformer模型分别存在忽略上下文关系和过拟合的问题。因此提出了SemaMIL方法。

**Method:** SemaMIL 方法集成了语义重排（SR）和语义引导检索状态空间模块（SRSM），前者通过可逆排列聚类并按语义排列相似的补丁，后者通过对状态空间参数的调整选择一组代表性查询，以提高全局建模能力。

**Conclusion:** SemaMIL方法在保持高准确性的同时，通过优化计算资源使用，解决了现有方法在计算病理学应用中的局限性。

**Abstract:** Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

**Conclusion:** 实验结果显示，SA-LDL可以有效捕捉标签模糊性的复杂结构特征，提高了年龄估计的准确性和鲁棒性，表明了其有效性和竞争力。

**Abstract:** Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the

**Motivation:** To overcome the challenges of reducing computational complexity and handling large deformations in deformable image registration by analyzing the influence of ConvNets on registration performance.

**Method:** Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework separates feature learning from flow estimation, using a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set of 3-layer flow estimators to build a Laplacian feature pyramid.

**Result:** EOIR demonstrates superior accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs across five datasets in different modalities and anatomical regions.

**Conclusion:** EOIR framework effectively achieves better balance between accuracy, efficiency, and smoothness in deformation image registration.

**Abstract:** Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The

**Motivation:** To evaluate LLM decision-making in a simplified yet complex environment that requires spatial reasoning and strategic planning.

**Method:** Using the Jump-Jump game as a testbed to assess LLM performance in making decisions based on spatial reasoning and planning.

**Result:** Not detailed in the abstract.

**Conclusion:** Not detailed in the abstract.

**Abstract:** The Jump-Jump game, as a simple yet challenging casual game, provides an
ideal testing environment for studying LLM decision-making capabilities. The
game requires players to precisely control jumping force based on current
position and target platform distance, involving multiple cognitive aspects
including spatial reasoning, physical modeling, and strategic planning. It
illustrates the basic gameplay mechanics of the Jump-Jump game, where the
player character (red circle) must jump across platforms with appropriate force
to maximize score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的用于评估视频领域多模态奖励模型（MRMs）的基准测试存在样本数量和多样性不足、评估维度不全面以及无法充分评估各种类型MRMs的问题。为了填补这些空白，引入了VideoRewardBench。

**Method:** 提出了VideoRewardBench，这是一个全面的基准测试，涵盖了视频理解的四个方面：感知、知识、推理和安全。通过AI辅助的数据管道，我们策划了一个高质量的偏好数据集，包含1,563个标注样本，包括1,482个唯一的视频和1,559个独特的问题，是之前问题最多的基准测试中的15倍。每个样本由一个视频-文本提示、一个选定的响应和一个被拒绝的响应组成。

**Result:** 对涵盖三个类别的28个多模态奖励模型进行了全面评估，结果显示，即使是表现最好的模型GPT-4o的总体准确率也仅为57.0%，最先进的开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B的准确率也只有53.3%。

**Conclusion:** 分析表明，通过引入VideoRewardBench，可以为推进视频领域的MRMs评估和技术发展提供一个具有挑战性和价值的测试基准。

**Abstract:** Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 面对各种复杂场景下视频数据的爆炸性增长，快速检索群体活动成为一个紧迫的问题。然而，很多任务只能检索完整的视频，而非活动粒度。为了应对这一问题，提出了STVH和M-STVH技术。

**Method:** 通过统一框架，STVH 技术能够同时建模单个对象动态及群体互动，捕捉群体视觉特征及位置特征的时空演变。进一步提出了 M-STVH（多关注点时空视频哈希）方法作为增强版，利用层次化的特征整合，使模型可以同时关注活动语义特征和目标视觉特征。

**Result:** 在公开的测试数据集上进行的对比实验中，STVH和M-STVH均取得了优秀的测试结果。

**Conclusion:** STVH和M-STVH技术有效解决了复杂场景下视频数据快速检索的问题，能够在不同的检索需求下同时捕捉活动和目标的特征，取得了出色的实验结果。

**Abstract:** With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

> TRUST is proposed to improve ultrasound image translation by preserving source content and transferring target style effectively, leading to better downstream task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the style gap in ultrasound images from different devices, which affects the performance of downstream tasks, by developing a method that explicitly filters relevant style features without blending content and style.

**Method:** Token-driven dual-stream framework named TRUST is proposed to transfer style while preserving content in ultrasound images. It includes a Token-dRiven (TR) module with data and model views, and auxiliary prompts for content representation alignment.

**Result:** TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and downstream task performance on ultrasound datasets.

**Conclusion:** The novel approach of TRUST demonstrates superior performance in ultrasound image-to-image translation, offering a solution to mitigate the style mismatch issue for downstream applications.

**Abstract:** Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

**Motivation:** 论文探讨了在AIaaS背景下，如何在黑盒模型不可见权重、训练数据或对数的情况下，有效训练本地模型。这些条件使得现有的迁移学习范式不切实际。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种名为ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC) 的方法，该方法通过利用DINOv2注意力图来动态选择黑盒模型推理的最佳尺度。ATGC通过熵评分注意力图来识别伪标注的有益尺度，从而实现有效的蒸馏。

**Result:** 实验结果展示了在仅使用黑盒模型的一热编码预测的条件下，跨多个数据集显著提高了性能。

**Conclusion:** 该研究揭示了开放词汇模型对于输入分辨率的敏感性，并提出的方法有效解决了这一问题，在黑盒模型环境下的监督学习中取得了显著效果。

**Abstract:** The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

Main category: cs.CV

> 本文介绍了一种新的类别增量语义分割方法，该方法解决了原型特征纠缠和背景增量问题，通过利用视觉-语言模型中的语义信息，实现状态-of-the-art性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文旨在解决类别增量语义分割（CISS）中遭遇的基本挑战——灾难性语义纠缠问题，这包括由于增量过程中语义不对齐导致的原型特征纠缠和由于数据动态演变引发的背景增量纠缠。

**Method:** 本文提出了一个受语言启发的自举解缠框架（LBD），利用预训练的视觉-语言模型（如CLIP）的先验类别语义来引导模型自主解缠特征。具体来说，该方法包括基于语言引导的原型解缠和基于流形相互背景解缠，前者通过手工艺文本特征作为拓扑模板引导新原型的解缠，后者通过多个可学习的原型和基于掩码池化的监督进行背景增量类别解缠。

**Result:** 通过整合软提示调优和编码器适配调整，填补了CLIP在密集和稀疏任务间的性能差距，实现了在Pascal VOC和ADE20k上的最新状态性能，特别是在多步场景中。

**Conclusion:** LBD框架解决了CISS中的灾难性语义纠缠问题，通过语言引导原型解缠和流形相互背景解缠技术，利用CLIP模型的先验类别语义有效提高了模型的持续学习能力和性能表现。

**Abstract:** Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 动机在于现有的学习方法在标准化医疗成像如CT上表现良好，但难以在未标准化的模态如MRI上普遍适用，因为其表现对外界条件（如MR对比度、分辨率、方向）变化敏感，这对广泛应用于多样化的临床协议造成限制。

**Method:** 本文介绍了BrainFM，这是一个用于人类大脑成像的多任务视觉基础模型。通过提出一种"轻度至重度"的同一受试者生成策略和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，BrainFM能够适应获取图像的外观变化（例如，模态、对比度、变形、分辨率、伪影），并且可以应用于五种基本的大脑成像任务，包括CT和T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI的图像合成、解剖分割、头皮到皮质距离测量、偏置场估计和配准。

**Result:** 在十一份公共数据集上评估了BrainFM的有效性，证明了其在所有任务和输入模态上的鲁棒性和有效性。

**Conclusion:** 结论是BrainFM能够适应各种获取图像的外观变化，并在多种基本大脑成像任务上表现出良好的性能和鲁棒性。

**Abstract:** Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

**Motivation:** 针对DiffusionDet在依赖上下文的场景中性能受限的问题，尤其在诸如车辆损伤评估的挑战性视觉领域，文章旨在通过综合利用全局和局部信息改进物体检测的效果。

**Method:** 文章采用了Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)方法，该方法利用跨注意力机制直接将通过单独的专用编码器捕获的全局场景上下文信息与局部提议特征进行融合。

**Result:** 本文提出了一种名为Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)的新方法，通过跨注意力机制将全局场景上下文与局部提议特征直接融合。实验结果显示，该方法在CarDD基准测试中超越了现有的最佳模型，为细粒度领域中的上下文感知物体检测设定了新的性能基准。

**Conclusion:** Context-Aware Fusion方法可以显著提高细粒度物体检测的性能，特别是在依靠上下文信息的任务中显示出优越性。

**Abstract:** Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

> 本文提出无训练框架DGL-RSIS，用于提升视觉语言模型在遥感图像分割中的表现，通过全局-局部解耦模块改善了视觉-文本特征的匹配，支持开放词汇的语义分割与指代表达分割。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 遥感图像分割中的视觉语言模型应用面临源自自然影像域到遥感域转换的挑战，这主要是由于遥感数据集中的类别多样性有限及自然影像与遥感影像之间的域差距。本文旨在通过提供一种无需重新训练视觉语言模型的框架来解决这一问题。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种无训练框架DGL-RSIS，用于解决视觉语言模型在遥感图像分割中的应用难题。该框架通过引入全局-局部解耦模块（GLD），首先将文本输入划分为局部类别名词和全局修饰词，使用自然语言处理技术；图像输入则通过无监督掩码提案网络分割为一组类别无关的掩码提案。其次，在局部尺度上通过一种新的上下文感知裁剪策略对图像块进行提取，并为文本输入引入遥感特定知识以丰富其内容，通过增强的文本特征与掩码导引的视觉特征匹配来支持开放词汇语义分割。最后，在全局尺度上提出了跨尺度Grad-CAM模块，使用全局修饰词的上下文信息来细化Grad-CAM图，并通过后续的掩码选择模块将像素级Grad-CAM激活集成到掩码级别的分割输出中，实现了全局和局部维度上的精确且可解释的对齐，用于指代表达分割。

**Result:** 暂无具体结果描述。

**Conclusion:** 本文通过提出的DGL-RSIS框架展示了一种无需训练的方法来提升视觉语言模型在遥感图像分割任务上的表现，通过全局和局部尺度上的视觉-文本特征对齐，实现了准确且可解释的指代表达分割。

**Abstract:** The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

**Conclusion:** 该研究提出了一种新型的甲烷检测方法，并展示了在未经正射校正的数据上训练的ML模型可以达到与传统方法相似的性能，同时提高了响应速度和降低了成本。

**Abstract:** Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets

**Conclusion:** MV-SSM在应对遮挡场景以及相机排列变化的情况下展现了优越性，并且在跨数据集的评估中也表现出色。

**Abstract:** While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP

**Abstract:** Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically

require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry

essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels

natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

*Yifei She,Huangxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

> FtZ, a novel framework, is introduced to enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of MLLMs by combining heterogeneous expert encoders, thus overcoming the visual perception bottleneck.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper aims to address the contradiction in MLLMs where they excel in complex semantic understanding but fail in basic visual tasks requiring precise detail perception. This limitation originates from the reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level semantics at the expense of fine-grained visual information.

**Method:** FtZ, a novel vision tower framework, is introduced to address the deficiency in basic visual tasks. It composes a semantically powerful anchor encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism, moving beyond the single-encoder design.

**Result:** Experiments show that the FtZ model significantly outperforms baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods on benchmarks that demand fine-grained visual understanding, such as TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME, and MM-Vet.

**Conclusion:** Composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient and effective method to surmount the visual perception bottleneck in MLLMs, suggesting a new design paradigm for next-generation AI systems with improved perceptual capabilities.

**Abstract:** Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

*Weilong Yan,Xin Zhang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

> 该论文提出了一种利用少量正常数据进行参数高效微调（PEFT）来实现天气泛化的深度估计的方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的单目深度估计方法在恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，依赖于合成数据或自监督学习，存在领域差距和破坏光度假设的问题。

**Method:** 该论文提出了参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，通过仅使用少量正常能见度的数据来实现天气泛化的深度估计。引入了选择-调优-维持（STM）策略，根据两种有效秩（熵秩和稳定秩）结构化分解预训练权重。调优阶段，基于熵秩和完全微调权重自适应选择适当的秩数和任务感知的奇异方向进行初始化；维持阶段，基于稳定秩执行主方向正则化。

**Result:** 大量的实验结果表明，STM策略不仅优于现有PEFT方法和全微调方法，甚至超越了使用合成恶劣天气数据训练的方法。

**Conclusion:** 该论文证明了STM策略在恶劣天气条件下进行深度估计的有效性，该策略能够灵活适应任务同时保持预训练模型的强泛化能力。

**Abstract:** Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

*Xiyao Wang,Chunyuan Li,Jianwei Yang,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Tianyi Xiong,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

> The paper describes a method to convert a critic model into a comprehensive vision-language model (LLaVA-Critic-R1) that excels in both evaluating and generating response outputs, achieving superior performance compared to existing specialized models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this research is to challenge the conventional separation of critics and policy models in vision-language modeling and explore the potential of critics to directly contribute to policy improvement.

**Method:** This paper proposes reorganizing preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals and directly performing reinforcement learning on a base generative model to create a multimodal critic that can generate responses.

**Result:** The proposed model, LLaVA-Critic-R1, not only excels as a critic but also matches or surpasses specialized reasoning VLMs in 26 visual reasoning and understanding benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that reinforcement learning on critic data can produce a unified model capable of both evaluation and generation, leading to more scalable and self-improving multimodal systems.

**Abstract:** In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

*Qingyu Wang,Xue Jiang,Guozheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

> The study introduces the CSFMamba Network for multimodal remote sensing image classification, effectively reducing computational complexity and improving feature fusion between HSI and LiDAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the issue of quadratic computational complexity in modeling longer-range dependencies with spatial-spectral features, which existing methods struggle with. Mamba reduces computational burden but cannot directly perform feature fusion, which this paper aims to rectify.

**Method:** The paper proposes the Cross State Fusion Mamba (CSFMamba) Network, which combines a preprocessing module tailored for the Mamba structure with CNN for extracting multi-layer features. It then uses a cross-state module based on the Mamba operator to fuse features from different modalities.

**Result:** Experiments on MUUFL and Houston2018 datasets demonstrate that the proposed CSFMamba outperforms Transformer methods while reducing the training burden.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the introduced CSFMamba Network can effectively capture the fusion relationship between Hyperspectral Image (HSI) and LiDAR modalities, providing stronger full-image understanding and achieving better performance with less computational cost.

**Abstract:** Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

**Conclusion:** 这一方法展示了变换器在基于骨架的人体动作识别任务中的潜力，并且通过开源代码和模型检查点来促进再现性。

**Abstract:** Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

*Raehyuk Jung,Seungjun Yu,Hyunjung Shim*

> The paper develops a benchmark to assess generalization of the projection layer in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and finds it performs well on unseen visual concepts, suggesting potential for efficient training with less aligned data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to systematically evaluate the projection layer's ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts in VLMs due to the layer's critical role in aligning visual features with the language model's embedding space.

**Method:** The paper proposes a benchmark for evaluating the projection layer's generalization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adapting object detection datasets into a prompting format and designing disjoint label set splits for training and testing.

**Result:** The experiments show that the projection layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes compared to seen ones across various settings, indicating a non-trivial level of generalization.

**Conclusion:** The research introduces a new evaluation framework for alignment generalization in VLM projection layers and suggests the possibility of efficient VLM training with limited aligned data, pointing out the layer behaves like a key-value memory mechanism.

**Abstract:** Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 近年来深度学习在皮肤病变分类模型的准确性方面取得了显著进步，支持医学诊断并促进公平医疗。然而，关于与肤色有关的潜在偏见的问题仍然存在，这可能影响诊断结果。提出此算法是为了应对实现不同肤色背景下诊断公平性的挑战。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种针对皮肤病变分类的公平性算法，该算法通过计算VGG网络卷积层特征图以及Vision Transformer的块和头的偏斜度，减少与肤色相关的不必要的通道，专注于病变区域，从而降低计算成本，减轻偏见。

**Result:** 该方法在降低计算成本和减少模型大小的同时，还能保持公平性，使其更加适用于实际应用。

**Conclusion:** 通过减少与肤色相关的特征渠道，专注于病变区域的方法，我们有效地减轻了偏见，同时降低了计算成本，使得公平性在皮肤病变分类中可以实现。

**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

> 提出了一种因果特征解释（CaFE）方法，通过有效感受野（ERF）来识别视觉变换器中稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征的真正驱动因素，揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖关系，提供了更忠实和语义精确的解释。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 理解视觉变换器中稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征的真实含义通常是通过检查特征激活最高的补丁来完成的。然而，自注意力机制在整个图像中混合信息，因此一个激活补丁往往与其他补丁共现，但并不引起该特征的激活。

**Method:** 通过利用有效感受野（ERF），将每个稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征的激活视为目标，并应用输入归因方法来识别因果驱动该激活的图像补丁。

**Result:** 通过ERF生成的地图经常与基于单纯激活位置的地图不同，这揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖，而补丁插入测试也证实了CaFE在恢复或抑制特征激活方面优于基于激活排序的补丁。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，CaFE在恢复或抑制视觉变换器中SAE特征激活方面比基于激活位置的方法更有效，强调了仅依赖激活位置解释特征可能带来的误解释风险。

**Abstract:** Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的视觉语言检索方法在处理描述抽象事件、隐含因果关系、时间背景或包含长且复杂的叙事的字幕时往往表现不佳。因此，本研究旨在提出一种新的框架来克服这些挑战。

**Method:** 我们的多阶段检索框架结合了密集文章检索、基于事件的语言模型重新排序、有效的图像集合以及基于字幕的语义匹配和排名感知选择。我们使用Qwen3进行文章搜索，Qwen3-Reranker进行上下文对齐，Qwen2-VL进行图像精确定分。为了进一步提高性能和鲁棒性，我们使用互秩融合（RRF）融合了多个配置的输出。

**Result:** 我们的系统在EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge Track 2的私有测试集上获得了最高的第一名得分。

**Conclusion:** 这证明了结合语言推理和多模态检索方法对于复杂、现实世界的图像理解的有效性。

**Abstract:** Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

**Motivation:** 传统的基于CNN的方法难以捕捉跨模态语义，因此我们提出了一种统一的视觉-语言框架，旨在解决耳鼻喉内窥镜图像分析中的三个临床相关任务。

**Result:** 我们的框架在ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand Challenge中实现了分类准确率和F1值为95%，图像到图像检索和文本到图像检索的Recall@1分别为0.93和0.92，MRR分数分别为0.97和0.96。

**Conclusion:** 我们的方法在有限的医疗数据上实现了高效的微调，提高了跨模态的表示多样性与语义对齐。

**Abstract:** We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical
settings.

**Result:** The proposed framework allows for the direct neural processing of unstructured 3D Gaussians by transforming them into Splatter Image format, embedding arbitrary messages while preserving visual quality and maintaining reliable extraction even under heavy distortion.

**Conclusion:** This research presents the first generalizable watermarking framework for 3DGS, offering an innovative solution that balances efficiency, imperceptibility, and robustness in the watermarking process.

**Abstract:** The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

**Abstract:** Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

*Haomiao Tang,Wenjie Li,Yixiang Qiu,Genping Wang,Shu-Tao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

> We propose Cancelable Product Quantization, a secure and efficient framework for face retrieval, which addresses the efficiency and security challenges of traditional methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the high computational inefficiency of homomorphic encryption while ensuring strong security guarantees for face retrieval systems.

**Method:** Our method includes a hierarchical two-stage framework: first, a high-throughput cancelable product quantization indexing module for fast candidate filtering, followed by a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for precise face ranking.

**Result:** Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves a good balance between effectiveness, efficiency, and security.

**Conclusion:** The proposed Cancelable Product Quantization framework provides a solution for secure face representation retrieval that balances effectiveness, efficiency, and security.

**Abstract:** Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

*Ganxi Xu,Jinyi Long,Jia Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

> 提出了一种使用denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)和cross-attention机制的图像到大脑信号生成框架，用于解决现有视觉假体生成真实大脑信号的难题，并在两个多模态数据集THINGS-EEG2和THINGS-MEG上展示了其有效性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决大脑编码阶段生成具有足够生物学相似性的大脑信号的难题，因为现有方法通常缺乏真实大脑响应的监督信号来验证预测刺激的生物合理性。

**Method:** 采用基于denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)的框架，并用cross-attention机制增强，通过迭代去噪学习解析并生成生物合理的脑信号，其中包含预训练的CLIP视觉编码器和增强的U-Net扩散模型。

**Result:** 框架在THINGS-EEG2和THINGS-MEG数据集上进行了评估，证明了生成生物合理性脑信号的有效性，并展示了所有受试者的训练和测试M/EEG拓扑图来直观展示M/EEG信号的个体内差异和个体间差异。

**Conclusion:** 提出的方法提供了一种动态交互视觉特征和脑信号表示的方式，通过这种方法可以实现更精细的对齐，这是一个重要的进步。

**Abstract:** Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

Main category: cs.CV

> OmniReason框架通过大型VLA数据集和新的时空推理AI架构，旨在提高自动驾驶汽车在动态环境中的决策能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）大多集中在静态场景理解上，忽略了真实驾驶场景中的时间维度。由于这种方法在动态环境中存在局限性，因此提出了OmniReason框架来增强时空推理能力。

**Method:** 该论文提出了一种名为OmniReason的框架，用于改进自动驾驶中的时空推理能力。框架包括两个部分：1）OmniReason-Data数据集，这是两个大规模的视觉-语言-动作数据集，具有密集的时空注释和自然语言解释；2）OmniReason-Agent架构，集成了稀疏时间记忆模块和解释生成器，以支持场景上下文建模和人类可解释的决策过程。

**Result:** OmniReason-Agent的性能优于现有方法，特别是在开放环规划任务和视觉问答（VQA）基准测试中表现出显著的改进。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，OmniReason-Agent在开放环规划和视觉问答基准测试中表现出色，并为解释性、基于时间的自动驾驶车辆建立了新能力。

**Abstract:** Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

*Changin Choi,Wonseok Lee,Jungmin Ko,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

> 为了克服传统单次检索增强生成框架的局限性，提出了MI-RAG框架，通过迭代推理和知识检索优化多模态理解和知识密集型视觉问答的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 虽然多模态大语言模型在多模态理解方面取得了显著进展，但它们在需要超越图像的外部知识的知识密集型视觉问题上的表现仍然有限。传统的单次检索增强生成框架往往无法收集足够的知识。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为MI-RAG的多模态迭代RAG框架，该框架基于推理来增强检索，并在跨模式的新检索知识上更新推理。在每次迭代中，MI-RAG利用累积的推理记录动态地制定多查询，这些查询驱动异构知识库之间的联合搜索，该知识库包含视觉关联和文本知识。新获得的知识被合成到推理记录中，逐渐精进理解。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，MI-RAG在Encyclopedic VQA、InfoSeek和OK-VQA等具有挑战性的基准测试中的检索召回率和答案准确性显著提高。

**Conclusion:** MI-RAG提供了一个可扩展的方法，能够增强跨多模态的组合推理。这种方法在知识密集型视觉问答任务中取得了显著的性能提升。

**Abstract:** While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

> The paper presents a novel framework for underwater 3D reconstruction, combining semantic guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting and achieving state-of-the-art performance on relevant datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the challenges of accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments, such as light distortion and limited visibility, by leveraging the potential of AI and integrating language models with visual processing.

**Method:** Our method integrates multimodal cross-knowledge with 3D Gaussian Splatting, embedding semantic features into each Gaussian primitive and supervising the training with CLIP extracted semantic features. A semantic consistency loss and a stage-wise training strategy ensure high-level scene understanding and quality improvement.

**Result:** The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets, showing significant improvements in PSNR.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in underwater 3D scene reconstruction, making it a strong choice for underwater exploration and marine perception applications.

**Abstract:** Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 为了应对胎儿超声标准平面分类所面临的挑战，如低组织对比度、边界模糊及操作相关图像质量变化，研究者提出改进方案。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种即插即用的自适应对比度调整模块（ACAM），灵感来自于医生在临床实践中调整图像对比度的做法，以便获得更清晰、更具区分性的结构信息。该模块使用浅层的质地敏感网络预测临床可行的对比度参数，通过可微映射将输入图像转换为多个对比度增强的视图，并在下游分类器中融合这些视图。

**Result:** 该模块在包含12,400张图像的多中心数据集中得到验证，不同模型的性能均得到提升，轻量级模型的准确率提高了2.02%，传统模型提高了1.29%，最先进的模型则提高了1.15%。

**Conclusion:** 该模块以其内容感知的适应能力，将随机预处理替换为基于物理原理的转换，并通过多视角融合提升对成像异质性的鲁棒性，为医学图像分析在实际图像质量变化下建立了新的范式。

**Abstract:** Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is

**Motivation:** 为了提高基于纹理的表面缺陷检测的准确性和可靠性，特别是针对元素的局部和全局处理。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种结合Gabor滤波器和模糊U-Net-ViT模型来提高基于纹理的表面缺陷检测的准确性和可靠性新方法。通过结合U-Net的局部特征训练和Vision Transformer的全局处理，该模型能够有效检测各种纹理下的缺陷。

**Result:** 在MVTec-AD、Surface Crack Detection和Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset等数据集上实现了平均面积曲线下（AUC）0.939的表现。消融研究表明，最优滤波器尺寸和噪声概率显著提高了缺陷检测性能。

**Conclusion:** 通过使用Gabor滤波器和优化参数设置如滤波器尺寸、sigma、波长、gamma和方向，在各种纹理表面的缺陷检测中取得了显著效果。

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决现有方法因运动模糊导致的姿态估计错误累积问题，影响3D场景重建质量。

**Method:** 我们的方法提出了一种统一的优化框架，将摄像机姿态作为可学习参数与3D高斯属性一起进行端到端优化。我们将摄像机和物体运动重新表述为3D高斯的SE(3)仿射变换，并制定统一的优化目标。为了稳定优化，我们引入了一个三阶段训练计划，交替优化摄像机姿态和3D高斯。首先固定姿态训练3D高斯，然后固定3D高斯优化姿态，最后一起优化所有可学习参数。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，我们的方法在重建质量和姿态估计准确性方面优于先前的动态去模糊方法。

**Conclusion:** 实验验证了提出方法在动态去模糊和3D场景重建上的有效性。

**Abstract:** Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Main category: cs.CV

> SegDINO是一个结合冻结的DINOv3骨干和轻量级解码器的高效分割框架，实现了与现有方法相比的最先进性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的分割方法通常依赖于多尺度融合或复杂的上采样中的重型解码器，这引入了实质性的参数开销和计算成本。本文旨在提出一种有效的方法，使其能够在不增加显著参数开销的前提下，利用DINO的表示能力完成分割任务。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种高效的分割框架SegDINO，它结合了冻结的DINOv3骨干和轻量级解码器。SegDINO从预训练的编码器中提取多层级特征，将它们对齐到一个共同的分辨率和通道宽度，并使用轻量级MLP头部直接预测分割掩模。此方法最小化了可训练参数的数量，同时保留了基础特征的表示能力。

**Result:** 实验表明，SegDINO在六个基准数据集上表现出了超越现有方法的一致先进性能，涵盖了三个医疗数据集(TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC)和三个自然图像数据集(MSD, VMD-D, ViSha)。

**Conclusion:** SegDINO通过最小化可训练参数数量并保留基础特征的表示能力，实现了高效分割。该工作已在多个数据集上证明了其先进性能，并提供了相应的代码。

**Abstract:** The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 卫星图像在许多领域发挥着重要作用，但是大气干扰和雾显著降低了图像的清晰度并降低了信息提取的准确性。 本文提出了一种Hybrid dehazing框架来应对这些挑战。

**Method:** SUFERNOBWA，该框架结合了Swin Transformer和U-Net，用于平衡全局上下文学习和局部细节恢复。该网络在编码器和解码器中使用了基于Swin Transformer的Residual-in-Residual Dense Block（SwinRRDB），以有效提取特征。此外，提出了一种组合损失函数，结合了L2损失、引导损失和一种新的分水岭损失，以增强结构边界保持并确保像素级别精度。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，提出的方法在RICE和SateHaze1K数据集上优于现有最佳模型。具体而言，在RICE数据集上，提出的方案实现了33.24 dB的PSNR和0.967的SSIM，与现有方法相比有显著改善。

**Conclusion:** 该研究为减轻卫星图像中的大气干扰提供了一种有效解决方案，并强调了其在各种遥感应用中的潜在应用前景。

**Abstract:** Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

### [217] [Look Beyond: Two-Stage Scene View Generation via Panorama and Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00843)
*Xueyang Kang,Zhengkang Xiang,Zezheng Zhang,Kourosh Khoshelham*

Main category: cs.CV

> This paper proposes a novel view synthesis method that addresses long-term view and scene consistency issues by decomposing the task into 360-degree scene extrapolation and novel view interpolation, using a panorama diffusion model and a video diffusion model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation of this paper is to improve the coherence and correct view alignment across long-range or looped trajectories in single-view novel view synthesis, which existing methods often struggle with.

**Method:** Our method consists of two stages: first, a panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from an input perspective image; second, perspective keyframes are sampled and warped from the panorama and used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model to generate novel views through a spatial noise diffusion process.

**Result:** Experiments on different scene datasets show that the proposed method achieves better global consistency in novel view generation compared to previous work.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method outperforms existing techniques in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories, even in challenging loop closure scenarios.

**Abstract:** Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文旨在解决量化感知训练（QAT）方法导致的分布外（OOD）数据泛化性能下降的问题，通过实验验证了这个问题，并提出了FQAT解决这一问题。

**Method:** FQAT引入了逐层冻结机制以减轻双重优化目标（即传统QAT和平坦度）之间的梯度冲突问题，并提出了一种基于梯度混乱的自适应冻结算法，以动态确定每个训练步骤冻结哪些层，从而有效解决层间干扰带来的挑战。

**Result:** 在具有影响力的OOD基准测试中，广泛的实验表明，在分布内和分布外的图像分类任务下，本文提出的方法优于现有最先进基线方法。

**Conclusion:** 所提出的方法FQAT能够有效解决QAT导致的分布外泛化性能下降问题，实验证明其在图像分类任务中优于现有方法。

**Abstract:** Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

*Zirui Zhou,Zizhao Peng,Dongyang Jin,Chao Fan,Fengwei An,Shiqi Yu*

> A new framework called DRF, which uses a combination of continuous skeleton maps and discrete postural asymmetry vectors, is introduced to enhance AI-based scoliosis screening, addressing limitations in existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to enhance AI-based scoliosis screening by utilizing pose data, overcoming the challenges of limited annotated pose datasets and the difficulty in modeling subtle asymmetries from noisy raw pose coordinates.

**Method:** The paper introduces the Dual Representation Framework (DRF) that integrates a continuous skeleton map with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV). The PAV-Guided Attention (PGA) module within DRF emphasizes clinically meaningful asymmetries using PAV as a clinical prior.

**Result:** The experiments conducted demonstrate that the proposed DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting scoliosis from pose data.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes with the successful introduction of the Scoliosis1K-Pose dataset and the dual representation framework, which improves the accuracy and interpretability of AI-based scoliosis screening by focusing on clinically relevant postural asymmetries. Additionally, the availability of the dataset and code for public use pledge to foster future research in this domain.

**Abstract:** Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

**Motivation:** The motivation is to reduce noise and computational costs caused by redundant or weakly relevant features in the prompt tuning process.

**Method:** Structure

**Result:** {"tldr": "Spotlighter is a lightweight framework that selects the most relevant visual tokens to improve both accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning for cross-modal tasks.", "motivation": "The motivation is to reduce noise and computational costs caused by redundant or weakly relevant features in the prompt tuning process.", "method": "Spotlighter evaluates visual tokens' activation from both sample-wise and semantic-wise perspectives, retains top-scoring tokens, and uses a class-specific semantic memory bank to refine the selection.", "result": "Spotlighter outperforms CLIP with up to 11.19\% increase in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to 0.8K additional FPS.", "conclusion": "Spotlighter is an effective and scalable method for enhancing prompt tuning in terms of both performance and efficiency with minimal additional parameters."}

**Conclusion:** Spotlighter is an effective and scalable method for enhancing prompt tuning in terms of both performance and efficiency with minimal additional parameters.

**Abstract:** CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 低光照Raw视频去噪是一个基本且具有挑战性的任务，因为严重信号降级是由高感光增益和短曝光时间引起的，而这些都是由视频帧率要求所限。

**Method:** 该论文提出了一种名为DarkVRAI的新框架，它在AIM 2025低光照Raw视频去噪挑战赛中获得第一名。框架包含两个主要贡献：1) 将利用捕获元数据的条件方案成功应用于图像去噪，以指导视频去噪过程中的对齐和去噪；2) 一种名为BOSS（Burst-Order Selective Scan）的机制，有效地建模噪声视频序列中的长程时间依赖性。

**Result:** 通过综合这些组件，DarkVRAI在严格的、真实的基准数据集上展示了最先进的性能，为低光照视频去噪设立了新的标准。

**Conclusion:** DarkVRAI为解决低光照视频去噪问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，并在竞赛中展示了卓越的性能。

**Abstract:** Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

> 本文提出了LangDC方法，通过语义密度感知的监督，动态调整视频令牌压缩比率，提高了计算效率，同时保持了较高的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 虽然大视频-语言模型在视频理解任务上取得了进展，但它们在处理大量视觉令牌时效率较低。现有的令牌压缩策略采用固定的压缩比率，忽略了不同视频片段之间的语义密度差异。这导致信息丰富的片段表示不足和对静态或内容贫乏片段进行不必要的计算。

**Method:** LangDC, 一种基于语言的动态令牌压缩器。该方法利用轻量级语言模型描述视频片段，将其转换成软标题令牌作为视觉表示。通过语义密度感知监督训练，LangDC能够覆盖下游任务推理所需的关键视觉线索，并根据场景丰富度动态调整压缩比率。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，与VideoGPT+相比，该方法减少了49%的FLOPs，同时还保持了具有竞争力的性能。此外，质性结果表明，该方法可以根据视频段的丰富性自适应地调整令牌压缩比率。

**Conclusion:** LangDC通过模仿人类动态表达所见的方式，能够根据视频内容的复杂性调整语言表达的详细程度，从而有效地优化了令牌压缩比率，提高了计算效率。

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

**Motivation:** 尽管3DGS在RGB数据上表现优异，但直接对额外光谱进行每次优化导致几何不一致的问题，难以实现高质量的重建效果。因此，研究提出不同策略来解决这一问题。

**Method:** 研究评估了三种策略：独立每通道重建，分割优化（首先优化RGB几何结构，然后对该模型的每个新通道的几何结构和带表示进行优化），以及联合优化。

**Result:** 研究通过三种策略--独立每通道重建、分割优化和联合优化--来评估多光谱成像（红、绿、红边和近红外）与3D高斯散射框架的结合效果，强调了联合优化策略在提高光谱重建和增强RGB结果方面的有效性，提出了将多光谱数据直接整合进球谐色彩成分中的建议。

**Conclusion:** 研究通过定量和定性方法展示，专用优化的联合策略在增强多光谱重建及RGB结果方面具有显著效果，并提出将多光谱数据直接整合进球谐色彩成分中。同时分析中明确了优化过程中引入光谱带的关键权衡，为多模态3DGS重建提供了实用的见解。

**Abstract:** We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 了解经验丰富的司机在雨天如何通过视觉行为来改变他们的视觉感知对于设计强大的驾驶监控系统（DMS）和提供高级驾驶员辅助系统（ADAS）的信息至关重要。

**Method:** 研究采用两步聚类方法分析了司机的视线行为：首先，在10秒的时间间隔内对注视点进行聚类，然后将聚类中心聚合为元聚类。此外，还使用了马尔可夫转移矩阵以及注视时间、注视仰角和方位角等指标，揭示了有意义的行为转变。

**Result:** 晴朗和下雨天气条件下，司机的整体视觉行为保持一致，都是集中注意力在道路上并偶尔检查后视镜。然而，在下雨的情况下，司机更频繁地看仪表盘，注视时间更长，注视角度更高，这表明认知焦点增加。

**Conclusion:** 这些研究结果对于理解在恶劣条件下的视觉注意力模式提供了宝贵的见解，并强调了利用注视建模来帮助设计更强大的ADAS和DMS的潜力。

**Abstract:** Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

**Motivation:** 在文本到图像生成中，对于诸如年龄或微笑等属性的细粒度控制仍然是一个挑战。现有方法通常分别训练每个属性的适配器，忽略了多个属性之间的纠缠关系，导致在同时控制多个属性时出现干扰。

**Method:** 我们的方法CompSlider能够为文本到图像（T2I）基础模型生成条件先验，以同时控制多个属性。我们引入了新颖的解耦和结构损失，可以在保持图像结构一致性的同时组合多个属性变化。

**Result:** 我们在多种图像属性上评估了我们的方法，并展示了该方法在视频生成中的通用性。

**Conclusion:** CompSlider方法能够在基础模型的潜在空间中工作，减少了训练和推理的计算负担，同时实现了多个属性的精确独立控制。

**Abstract:** In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

### [227] [Seeing through Unclear Glass: Occlusion Removal with One Shot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01033)
*Qiang Li,Yuanming Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

> The paper presents a model capable of cleaning images taken through variously contaminated glass by adapting to different contaminants using self-supervised learning and a one-shot test-time adjustment mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to develop a method that effectively cleans images taken through glass contaminated by a wide range of occluders, going beyond just raindrops which most previous works focused on.

**Method:** This paper proposes an all-in-one model utilizing a one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism and a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to adapt to different types of glass contaminants.

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, particularly for unseen contaminated images.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that the all-in-one model with self-supervised auxiliary learning and one-shot test-time adaptation performs better in cleaning realistic and unseen contaminated images compared to existing methods.

**Abstract:** Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 虽然基础模型已经在计算病理学的高层诊断任务中取得了显著成功，但低级别的图像增强这一关键挑战大多未得到解决。实际应用中的病理图像经常受到噪声、模糊和低分辨率等退化的影响，当前的方法针对像去噪或超分辨率这样的单独问题设计，缺乏处理实践中遇到的各种低级别视觉挑战的灵活性。因此，我们提出了解决这一差距的方法。

**Method:** 我们提出了首个统一的低级别病理基础模型（LPFM），它能够在包括超分辨率、去模糊和去噪在内的图像恢复任务中提升图像质量，以及实现图像翻译任务如虚拟染色（H&E和特殊染料），所有这些功能都通过一个可适应的架构实现。我们的方法引入了一种对比预训练编码器，从1.9亿张未标记的病理图像中学习到可迁移的、染色不变的特征表示，从而实现对退化模式的鲁棒识别。通过文本提示，统一的条件扩散过程能够动态适应特定任务，确保对输出质量的精准控制。

**Result:** LPFM在87810张全幻灯片图像上进行了训练，展示了在大多数任务中（56/66）统计显著的改进（p<0.01），对于图像恢复任务，PSNR提高了10-15%，对于虚拟染色任务，SSIM提高了12-18%。

**Conclusion:** 通过提出LPFM，我们为解决病理学中低级别图像处理的多样化挑战提供了一个统一和有效的解决方案。

**Abstract:** Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

**Motivation:** 本研究旨在解决当前用于医疗图像异常检测的 CNN 和 Transformer 模型存在的固有问题，即 CNN 模型感受野有限，难以捕捉广泛上下文信息，而 Transformer 模型处理高分辨率医疗图像时计算成本高昂。希望通过 Mamba 框架的线性复杂度处理长序列的优势，提出 SpectMamba 架构来提升医疗图像异常检测的效率和准确性。

**Abstract:** Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the computational bottlenecks of video diffusion Transformer models, particularly their quadratic complexity and inefficiency with full attention when producing high-resolution and long-duration videos.

**Method:** Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework is introduced to improve the efficiency of video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models by dynamically sparsifying Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention.

**Result:** Experiments show that BSA reduces FLOPs by up to 20x and achieves 17.79x faster attention training, while maintaining or improving the generative quality compared to full attention.

**Conclusion:** The BSA framework effectively accelerates the training of video DiT models, offering significant computational savings while preserving or enhancing the quality of generated videos.

**Abstract:** Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

Main category: cs.CV

> 本文提出了VEPE框架，通过对时空Transformer组件的设计和实例一致性机制的引入，提高视频中的人体姿态估计性能和效率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 视频基于人体姿态估计算法旨在解决静态图像模型难以处理的问题，如运动模糊、焦外模糊和遮挡等。现有方法将问题分为两个阶段处理，分别进行了空间和时间维度上的分离，不能有效捕获全局的时空上下文。此外，这种方法依赖于单独的检测器和复杂的后处理，如RoI裁剪和NMS，降低了视频场景的推理效率。

**Method:** 本文提出了一个名为VEPE的简单灵活的框架，用于视频中端到端的姿态估计。该框架利用了三个关键的时空Transformer组件：时空姿态编码器(STPE)，时空可变形记忆编码器(STDME)，以及时空姿态解码器(STPD)。此外，为了减少跨帧姿态查询匹配过程中的不匹配问题，引入了一个实例一致性机制，目的是增强跨帧实例查询的一致性和差异性，实现实例追踪功能，从而准确指导姿态查询进行跨帧匹配。

**Result:** 在Posetrack数据集上的广泛实验表明，本方法超越了大多数两阶段模型，并提高了300%的推理效率。

**Conclusion:** 本文提出的VEPE框架通过利用时空Transformer组件和实例一致性机制，可以改善姿态估计中的时空一致性和推理效率。

**Abstract:** Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 在点云压缩中，重建点云的质量依赖于全局结构和局部上下文，而现有的方法通常顺序处理全局和局部信息，并且这两类信息之间缺乏交流。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为PVINet的点-体素交织网络，该网络可以并行捕获全局结构特征和局部上下文特征，并在每个尺度进行交互，从而增强特征感知效率。具体来说，PVINet 包含一个基于体素的编码器（Ev）以提取全局结构特征，一个基于点的编码器（Ep）以建模每个体素中心的局部上下文。特别地，引入了一种新颖的条件稀疏卷积，它应用点嵌入来动态定制用于体素特征提取的核，从而促进Ep到Ev的特征交互。在解码过程中，基于体素的解码器采用条件稀疏卷积，将点嵌入作为指导以重构点云。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，PVINet在基准数据集上的表现与最先进的方法相比具有竞争力。

**Conclusion:** PVINet通过并行处理全局和局部信息，并引入条件稀疏卷积来加强特征的交互，从而在点云压缩任务上取得了好的结果。

**Abstract:** In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

> 提出FICGen方法改进降质场景中的L2I生成，解决上下文幻觉问题，通过频率原型和注意力机制提高生成质量，实验结果显示其显著优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的L2I生成模型在应用于降质场景（例如，低光、水下）时表现出生成保真度有限及与用户提供的布局对齐效果弱的问题，这主要是由于“上下文幻觉困境”引起。

**Method:** FICGen是一个新的频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式，它将降质图像的频率知识转移到潜在扩散空间中，这有助于在用户提供的布局指导下生成与周围环境一致的降质实例。FICGen包含两个主要步骤：首先，引入一个可学习的双查询机制，每个查询都配有一个专用的频率重采样器，从训练集中预先收集的降质示例中提取上下文频率原型；其次，使用视觉频率增强注意力机制将频率原型注入到降质生成过程中。为了减轻上下文幻觉和属性泄露问题，开发了一个实例连贯性图来调节个体实例和其周围环境之间的潜在空间解耦，并配合一个自适应空间频率聚合模块来重构空间频率混合的降质表示。

**Result:** 在包括严重低光到轻微模糊在内的五个涉及各种降质场景的基准上进行的广泛实验表明，FICGen在生成保真度、对齐度以及下游辅助可训练性方面普遍优于现有的L2I方法。

**Conclusion:** FICGen证明了通过引入频率引导和强调频率原型的使用，可以提高降质场景中的图像合成质量。

**Abstract:** Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的均匀2D/1D网格分词方法在表示不同形状、纹理和位置的区域时缺乏灵活性，限制了其特征表示的有效性。采用空间自适应分词可以解决这一问题，以提高图像表示和生成的效果。

**Method:** 通过使用参数化的二维高斯模型动态地刻画不同图像区域的形状、位置和纹理，提出了一个名为GPSToken的新型高斯参数化空间自适应分词框架，该框架首先采用熵驱动算法将图像分割为纹理均质的不同大小区域，然后将每个区域参数化为一个2D高斯（均值代表位置，协方差代表形状）结合纹理特征。接着训练了一个专门的转换器来优化高斯参数，从而实现位置/形状的连续自适应和内容感知特征提取。在解码期间，高斯参数化的分词通过可微渲染器重新构造为2D特征图，连接自适应分词和标准解码器完成端到端训练。这种分词方式解耦了空间布局（高斯参数）与纹理特征，使得可以进行高效的两阶段生成：首先是使用轻量级网络的结构布局合成，然后是在结构条件下的纹理生成。

**Result:** 实验表明，GPSToken实现了图像重建和生成任务中的最新水平，使用128个分词，分别实现了0.65和1.50的rFID和FID分数。

**Conclusion:** GPSToken通过对图像区域实施空间自适应分词实现了图像表示和生成领域的重要进展，该方法提供了一种具有显著优越性的空间自适应图像分词解决方案。

**Abstract:** Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的SSL方法主要集中在生成参考预测的策略上，而忽略了不同类型未标记像素的异质性以及有标签数据中的潜在噪声，针对这些问题，我们提出了本研究。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种基于空间异质性损失的通用框架MetaSSL，该框架通过同时利用参考预测和监督预测之间的不确定性和一致性信息，为不同像素分配不同的权重。具体来说，我们将未标记数据上的预测分为四个区域：一致且自信（UC）、一致但可疑（US）、矛盾且自信（DC）和矛盾且可疑（DS），其中提出了一种自适应阈值来区分自信预测和可疑预测。该异质性损失也被应用于有标签图像以考虑潜在的注释噪声。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，我们的方法可以在不同的数据集上显著提高分割性能。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，当与现有的SSL框架集成时，我们的方法在不同的数据集上显著提高了分割性能。

**Abstract:** Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

**Result:** 研究结果显示，流行的视觉编码器在识别对给定文本查询感兴趣的视频帧方面存在能力局限。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，开发更先进的关键帧识别技术对于提高视频MLLMs的效率可能是必要的。

**Abstract:** Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of reconstructing dynamic visual scenes from EEG signals, which include low spatial resolution of EEG, temporal mismatch between neural recordings and video, and insufficient use of semantic information within brain activity.

**Method:** A novel framework named DynaMind for reconstructing video scenes from EEG signals, consisting of three core modules: Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR).

**Result:** On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), with improvements of 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points in video and frame-based reconstruction accuracies, respectively. It also shows a 9.4% improvement in SSIM and a 19.7% reduction in FVMD, highlighting superior visual fidelity and temporal coherence.

**Conclusion:** A critical advancement in the field of brain decoding, closing the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics.

**Abstract:** Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

> 该研究提出SegAssess框架，解决了现有无监督图像分割质量评估方法在评估粒度、完整性和泛化能力方面的不足，并展示了优越的零样本泛化能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有基于深度学习的无监督分割质量评估方法存在粗略的评估粒度、不完整的评估以及较差的泛化能力等问题。为解决这些问题，提出了新的全景质量映射（PQM）范式及其实现框架SegAssess。

**Method:** 该论文提出了SegAssess框架，采用了改进的分割一切模型（SAM）架构，将其输入蒙版作为提示，以实现细粒度的四分类全景分割任务。该方法还引入了边缘引导紧缩（EGC）分支和聚合语义滤波器（ASF）模块，以提高在具有挑战性的边缘处的预测精度，并采用增强混合采样（AMS）训练策略以提高跨域鲁棒性和零样本泛化能力。

**Result:** 实验结果表明SegAssess在32个来自6个来源的数据集上实现了最佳性能，并表现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

**Conclusion:** SegAssess通过PQM实现了无监督分割质量评估的鲁棒性和泛化性，确立了一种新的解决方案。

**Abstract:** High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

**Motivation:** PrediTree数据集填补了森林监测能力上的空白，通过提供高分辨率的LiDAR衍生冠层高度图与多时相多光谱图像的组合，允许训练基于多个以往观测的深度学习方法来预测树木生长情况。

**Method:** 提出了一个编码器-解码器框架，该框架利用多时相多光谱图像以及冠层高度图时间戳与各图像采集日期之间的时间差异来预测冠层高度。实验表明，基于PrediTree数据集训练的U-Net架构提供了最高的蒙版均方误差值为11.78%，比下一个最佳架构ResNet-50高出约12%，并且将误差减少了约30%，相比仅使用红、绿、蓝三个频段的情况。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，U-Net架构在PrediTree数据集上的表现最好，其误差比ResNet-50架构和仅使用RGB频段的情况分别减少了12%和30%。

**Conclusion:** U-Net架构在预测树高上表现出色，且该PrediTree数据集及其处理和训练代码库在公共平台上公开发布。

**Abstract:** We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This
dataset is publicly available on \href{URL}{HuggingFace}, and both processing
and training codebases are available on \href{URL}{GitHub}.

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明，DcMatch框架在非刚性多形状匹配任务上表现出色，优于现有方法，提供了更准确和连贯的对应关系。

**Abstract:** Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

**Abstract:** Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code

**Motivation:** 当前场景图生成基准的词汇非常有限，使得开放词汇场景图生成模型的评估效率低下。同时，模型在预训练时依赖于质量较差的弱监督数据。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种新的无参考评价指标，用于公平评估视觉语言模型在开放词汇关系预测中的能力。此外，针对开放词汇场景图生成对低质量弱监督数据的依赖问题，我们提出了一种新的解决方案，通过视觉语言模型的区域特定提示调整，快速生成高质量的合成数据。

**Conclusion:** 本文提出的新方法不仅能够更公平地评估视觉语言模型的开放词汇能力，而且通过生成高质量合成数据提高了预训练模型的表现。

**Abstract:** Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

**Motivation:** 传统的肿瘤空间异质性分析方法在连续组织切片中存在空间对齐不准确的问题，严重影响了原位病理解释。为了获得更准确的虚拟染色模式，需要开发新的方法。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为PRINTER的弱监督框架，该框架整合了原型驱动的染色模式解耦策略和形变感知对抗学习策略，用于准确学习IHC染色模式并保持H&E染色细节。该方法主要有三大创新点：(1)原型驱动的染色模式传输和显式的图像内容-风格解耦；(2)通过变形结构对齐来连接H&E和IHC域的循环注册-合成框架GapBridge；(3)形变感知的对抗学习，通过生成器和形变感知注册网络共同对抗训练一个以风格为焦点的判别器。

**Conclusion:** 这项工作为虚拟染色提供了一个稳健和可扩展的解决方案，推动了计算病理学领域的发展。

**Abstract:** Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 高质量的标注数据对于训练准确的文档转换模型至关重要，尤其是在表格、公式和多列文本等复杂格式的领域。然而，人工标注既昂贵又耗时，而使用现有模型的自动标注在处理这些挑战性场景时往往不够准确。因此，通过教师模型输出进行学生模型训练可以显著限制其实战应用中的表现。

**Method:** 提出了一种全自动、无需蒸馏的框架，包含两个阶段来构建高质量的文档提取数据集和模型，能够处理多样化的文档格式和布局。第一阶段是生成大规模多样化的人工合成数据，使模型能够以统一格式提取关键元素，并具有良好的初始性能。第二阶段是采用自我改进的方法进一步适应模型，首先使用微调后的模型标注真实文档，然后应用一系列过滤策略验证标注质量，最后在验证后的数据集上重新训练模型。通过反复迭代这一过程，逐步提升模型的转换能力和生成数据的质量。

**Result:** 训练了一个公共的POINTS-1.5模型，获得了POINTS-Reader，其性能超过了众多现有的公共和专有模型。

**Conclusion:** 经过迭代训练过程，本研究构建了能够处理多种文档格式和布局的高质量模型POINTS-Reader，并在多种基准测试中表现出色。

**Abstract:** High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明，相比于其他方法，FantasyHSI在泛化能力、长期任务完成度和物理真实感方面均有显著提升。

**Abstract:** Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

**Abstract:** 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的方法多集中在单视图下，本研究认为采用两视图预训练范式能够引入更大的多样性和方差，从而使预训练更具挑战性和信息量。因此，本研究旨在探索点云学习中两视图学习的潜力。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种名为Point-PQAE的跨重构生成范式，该方法首先生成两个解耦的点云视图，然后从一个视图重构另一个视图。研究实施了一种点云视图生成的裁剪机制，并提出了一种新颖的位置编码来表示两个解耦视图之间的3D相对位置。

**Result:** 与前人单模态自重构方法相比，本研究采用两视图的跨重构方式，显著提升了3D自监督学习的难度，从而在3D自我监督学习中表现超越。特别是在三种变体的ScanObjectNN数据集上，使用Mlp-Linear评估协议下，比自我重构基线（Point-MAE）分别提高了6.5%，7.0%，和6.7%。

**Conclusion:** 本研究展示了利用两视图预训练范式进行点云自监督学习具有更高的潜力，其方法可以显著提升3D自我监督学习模型的性能。

**Abstract:** Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的图像描述系统倾向于生成通用性的描述，无法捕捉到事件级别的语义，这对于新闻报道和数字归档等应用场景是不足的。

**Method:** ReCap系统由三部分组成：文章检索系统、上下文提取框架和基于语义高斯归一化的描述生成系统。

**Result:** 在OpenEvents V1数据集上，ReCap系统取得了0.54666的综合评分，在EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge的Track 1项目中排名第二。

**Conclusion:** ReCap系统通过整合视觉感知和现实世界知识，提升图像描述的质量，特别适用于高要求的应用场景。

**Abstract:** Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with
real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image
understanding in high-stakes domains. The code is available at

**Method:** 通过一个探索性实验来了解视觉语言模型中潜在语义的分布和动态，提出了X-Agent框架，使用感知潜在语义的'代理'来控制跨模态注意力机制，优化潜在语义的动态并放大其可感知性。

**Conclusion:** X-Agent框架证明了通过优化潜在语义的动态并增强其可感知性，可以显著改善开放词汇语义分割性能。

**Abstract:** Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

**Motivation:** SAR目标检测面临着斑点噪声、小目标模糊以及在轨计算资源限制等挑战。现有的方法主要集中在SAR特定的架构改进上。本研究则探索将现有的轻量级目标检测器应用于SAR目标检测，并通过NAS改进其性能。

**Method:** 本研究将神经架构搜索（NAS）应用于轻量级目标检测器YOLOv10，用于改进合成孔径雷达（SAR）目标检测。通过构建广泛的搜索空间并利用进化搜索，系统地优化了网络结构，特别是在骨干网络架构方面。

**Conclusion:** 本研究首次将NAS引入SAR目标检测，提供了利用NAS进行实际应用的新视角。

**Abstract:** Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

**Motivation:** 鉴于雷达传感器在光照和天气条件不佳时的稳健性，相对于相机而言，从雷达传感器中高效地检测物体最近变得非常流行。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种高效的雷达对象检测模型，用于Range-Doppler (RD) 雷达图。首先，我们通过热图和灰度图表示RD雷达图，以获得高层对象特征和精细纹理特征。然后，设计适配器分支、转换模块（两种模式）和主辅助融合模块，有效提取、交换和融合多表示输入的特征。此外，我们构建了一个子网络，并使用一种一次性神经架构搜索方法来提高模型的效率同时保持高性能。

**Abstract:** Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable
accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art
performance on RADDet and CARRADA datasets with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1,

> 提出了一种新的跨域小样本分割方法FSS-TIs，通过常微分方程和傅立叶变换，以改进现有的分割方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的多模态方法由于独立性导致知识流动不畅，无法充分挖掘合作潜力。因此，文章提出一种新的方法来改进这一点。

**Method:** Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs)通过基于常微分方程和傅立叶变换的一个整体模块，提出了一种结构精简的方法。FSS-TIs假设领域特定特征和领域无关特征之间的谱之间存在ODE关系，通过这一过程中的迭代变换和仿射变换的随机扰动，来重新制定领域无关特征表示空间的探索和多样潜在目标领域分布的模拟。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，FSS-TIs在现有的CD-FSS方法中表现出优越性，深入的消融研究表明FSS-TIs具有跨域适应性。

**Conclusion:** FSS-TIs不仅在理论上有效地改进了现有方法，而且实验证明，它在跨域小样本分割任务中表现出更高的性能。这种方法为未来的跨域分割任务提供了一种新的见解和工具。

**Abstract:** Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

*Alexandros Gkillas,Nikos Piperigkos,Aris S. Lalos*

Main category: cs.CV

> Researchers develop a new framework for autonomous driving that improves upon low-cost LiDAR data to achieve high-resolution segmentation performance, comparable to high-cost LiDAR systems, by integrating super-resolution and semantic segmentation processes with joint optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this research is to reduce the dependency on expensive high-resolution LiDAR sensors by improving the accuracy of semantic segmentation from lower-cost, sparser LiDAR data.

**Method:** The paper presents an end-to-end framework that integrates LiDAR super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation, using joint optimization to enhance the SR process with semantic information. A novel SR loss function guides the focus on areas of interest. The SR model is lightweight, requiring fewer parameters compared to existing approaches, while still being compatible with segmentation networks.

**Result:** The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve segmentation performance similar to systems using high-resolution and expensive 64-channel LiDAR data.

**Conclusion:** The research concludes that integrating semantic information into the super-resolution process can improve the quality of point clouds from low-cost LiDAR sensors, achieving segmentation performance comparable to high-resolution data without the associated costs.

**Abstract:** High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

Main category: cs.CV

> PGRD is a diffusion-based framework for medical image segmentation that captures full conditional distributions, showing improved performance with fewer sampling steps compared to other methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper aims to address the ambiguity in medical image segmentation by developing a model that captures full conditional distributions, rather than just a single prediction.

**Method:** PGRD embeds discrete labels into a continuous space and uses a diffusion process guided by a coarse prior predictor to learn voxel-wise distributions. Deep diffusion supervision is also employed to stabilize training.

**Result:** The proposed method achieves higher Dice scores and lower negative log-likelihood/expected calibration error values than Bayesian, ensemble, and vanilla diffusion methods while being more sampling efficient.

**Conclusion:** PGRD is an effective framework that not only provides improved calibration and performance but also requires fewer sampling steps, making it a promising approach for medical image segmentation.

**Abstract:** Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

**Motivation:** To improve the localization accuracy of images in essential applications and services by leveraging social media data and smartphone cameras, seeing the challenges and high value in applying traditional computer vision techniques to such data.

**Method:** This paper integrates open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation for street-level geolocalization from images, using the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M).

**Result:** The approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance on three widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k), demonstrating higher accuracy without the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining.

**Conclusion:** The research suggests that retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models offer a scalable and accessible alternative to traditional methods that require Training Models from scratch.

**Abstract:** Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

**Conclusion:** AgroSense is a practical, scalable solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and indication of future lightweight multimodal AI systems.

**Abstract:** Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained

**Conclusion:** 本文通过M3Ret模型在医学影像检索领域展示出显著的跨模态学习能力，并为未来开发多模态医学影像理解的基础模型提供了积极前景。

**Abstract:** Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The research aims to overcome the limitations of scarce data and high tuning costs associated with fine-tuning large video diffusion models for IPT2V, by enhancing the quality of input and refining the generation process.

**Method:** Identity-preserving text-to-video generation involves enhancing prompts and reference images and optimizing identity preservation during video generation using the Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance Enhancement (TPIGE) framework.

**Result:** The proposed method outperforms previous work and excels in automatic and human evaluations, taking first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025 Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge.

**Conclusion:** The TPIGE framework effectively bridges the semantic gap and enhances identity preservation and video quality, proving its robustness and broad applicability in IPT2V tasks without incurring additional training costs.

**Abstract:** Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

**Conclusion:** The proposed Uirapuru framework effectively tackles the unique challenges of steerable cameras, offering significant improvements over existing methods in real-time video analytics.

**Abstract:** Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

**Abstract:** Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform
illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose
three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust
24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at

### [265] [Enhancing Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Robust Alignment Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01383)
*Long Zhang,Peipei Song,Jianfeng Dong,Kun Li,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

> This paper addresses the PRVR challenge with RAL, a framework incorporating probabilistic modeling and learnable confidence gates, resulting in more robust query-video alignment and improved performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the limitations of existing PRVR methods which are vulnerable to data uncertainty caused by query ambiguity and partial video relevance.

**Method:** The paper proposes Robust Alignment Learning (RAL) framework for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). It uses probabilistic modeling, representing videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions, and introduces learnable confidence gates to dynamically weight similarity.

**Result:** Experiments across different retrieval backbones show that the proposed RAL framework improves retrieval performance in PRVR tasks.

**Conclusion:** The probabilistic modeling approach along with the use of confidence gates, as implemented in RAL, effectively handles data uncertainty in PRVR tasks, providing a plug-and-play solution to enhance existing retrieval architectures.

**Abstract:** Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 体素格是医学成像的标准，但由于其分辨率限制、拓扑信息损失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题，RibPull 方法利用隐式占用场来作为更好的解决方案，更好地处理稀疏数据和提供更多几何信息。

**Method:** RibPull 方法使用隐式占用场连接计算几何和医学成像。相较于离散方法，隐式3D表示法通过使用连续函数更有效地处理稀疏和噪声数据。我们使用预测3D点是否在对象内部或外部的神经占用场来表示CT扫描的肋骨。此外，我们应用基于拉普拉斯的收缩来提取肋骨的中轴，以体现几何操作从连续坐标基3D场景表示中相对于体素基表示中的巨大收益。

**Result:** 在RibSeg数据集上的20个医学扫描进行方法评估，RibSeg数据集是RibFrac数据集的扩展。

**Conclusion:** RibPull 方法展示了隐式3D场景表示如何优于基于体素的表示，特别是在稀疏数据和几何信息表示上。

**Abstract:** We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的方法在图像编辑和修复中主要关注生成内容的语义控制，而往往忽视了保持图像风格一致性的任务。风格一致性对于图像的连贯性和视觉吸引力至关重要。

**Method:** NSD利用先进的扩散模型，该模型结合了两个并行的交叉注意力机制，分别处理文本和风格信息，以同时实现语义控制和风格一致性。此外，提出了Progressive Self-style Representational Learning (PSRL)模块，用于捕捉细粒度的风格表示。

**Result:** 通过对建立的全面基准进行广泛实验，验证了提出框架的有效性。

**Conclusion:** 介绍了一种新的框架NSD，能够实现选定场景区域的逼真编辑，同时确保与用户意图语义上的对齐和与环境风格上的一致性。此外，还建立了该任务的综合评价基准。

**Abstract:** Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Develop a compact and efficient image quality assessment metric that can perform well across FR-IQA benchmarks and also serve as a perceptual loss for generative models, leading to improved performance in various image processing tasks.

**Method:** MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric trained with pseudo-MOS supervision to assess image quality without needing large human-labeled datasets. Utilized as a perceptual loss in image and latent domains, enhancing optimization efficiency and performance in tasks like denoising and super-resolution by applying a spatial masking model and curriculum learning strategy.

**Result:** MILO outperforms existing metrics on FR-IQA benchmarks, supports fast inference for real-time applications, and enhances perceptual optimization, particularly in tasks like denoising and super-resolution by leveraging spatial masking and curriculum learning.

**Conclusion:** MILO not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in image quality assessment but also provides a practical tool for perceptual optimization, offering faster and more efficient outcomes in generative pipeline applications.

**Abstract:** We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 虽然许多研究已经解决了卡路里追踪的问题，但现有方法面临多个挑战，如无法准确识别多种食物、处理图像缩放及标准化困难、以及对西方饮食侧重较多。

**Method:** 我们首先建立了一个包含孟加拉国各地流行街头食品的多样化数据集。然后，我们通过修改最先进的视觉模型YOLOv8开发了一个优化的卡路里估算系统。

**Result:** 改进后的模型获得了优越的分类和分割效果，与基础版本相比仅略有增加计算复杂性。整体系统在卡路里估算方面表现优异。

**Conclusion:** 我们的系统在卡路里估计方面取得了优异的表现，达到了平均绝对误差（MAE）6.94、均方根误差（RMSE）11.03和R²得分为96.0%，使之成为现实生活中的食物卡路里计算的有效且精确的解决方案。

**Abstract:** As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

> This paper proposes a new framework called InfoScale to improve variable-scaled image generation by addressing specific issues in DMs using three modules that handle information loss, aggregation, and distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The key challenge lies in the differing amounts of information across resolutions, which requires varying information conversion procedures to generate variable-scaled images. DMs currently lose performance when tested on resolutions different from the training scale.

**Method:** InfoScale, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image generation, including Progressive Frequency Compensation module, Adaptive Information Aggregation module, and Noise Adaptation module to address the challenges in DMs related to dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise respectively.

**Result:** Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in variable-scaled image generation.

**Conclusion:** The InfoScale framework can improve the performance of DMs in variable-scaled image generation by addressing the challenges related to dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.

**Abstract:** Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

**Conclusion:** 研究结果验证了将CNN与选择性SSM相结合的潜力，并为微妙的视觉理解任务提供了一个强大的新架构模式。

**Abstract:** The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with

**Abstract:** Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model

Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results

**Conclusion:** 通过引入真实数据和合成数据结合的训练策略，我们的方法能够更好地重建3D头发结构，为头发的重建提供了一个新的技术方案。

**Abstract:** We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of prevalent voxel-based and pillar-based methods for point cloud processing in 3D object detection within autonomous driving, which either offer high accuracy at the cost of slower inference speed or faster inference but lower accuracy.

**Method:** A new point cloud processing technique that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices and introduces Slice Interaction Network (SIN) to maintain vertical relationships across slices.

**Result:** PointSlice achieves state-of-the-art detection results with fewer parameters and faster inference speed on multiple datasets. For instance, on the nuScenes dataset, it achieves a 66.74 mAP detection result.

**Conclusion:** PointSlice offers a solution with both high detection accuracy and efficient inference speed, making it a promising approach for 3D object detection in autonomous driving.

**Abstract:** 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of

horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 快速且准确地从点云生成3D形状对于机器人学、AR/VR以及数字内容创作等领域至关重要。

**Method:** ConTiCoM-3D采用了一种连续时态一致性模型，通过集成TrigFlow启发的连续噪声调度与基于Chamfer距离的几何损失，直接在点云空间中合成3D形状。这种方法无需离散扩散步骤、预训练教师模型或潜在空间编码。

**Result:** 实验中，在ShapeNet基准测试上，ConTiCoM-3D在质量与效率方面与最先进的扩散和潜在一致性模型相比，达到了匹配或超越的效果。

**Conclusion:** ConTiCoM-3D建立了一个实用框架，适用于可扩展的3D形状生成。

**Abstract:** Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** nnUNet框架在训练脚本中自动调整了大部分超参数，但忽视了网络内部超参数的调优，这限制了模型的泛化能力。本研究通过引入自适应卷积模块，旨在克服这一缺陷。

**Method:** 提出了自适应卷积模块（Self-Adaptive Convolution Module），它能够根据不同的数据集动态调整卷积核的大小，该模块被集成到了MSA2-Net的多尺度卷积桥和多尺度融合解码器中，使网络能够更有效地捕捉全局和局部特征。

**Result:** MSA2-Net在Synapse、ACDC、Kvasir和Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) 数据集上的Dice系数得分分别为86.49%、92.56%、93.37%和92.98%，表明了模型在医学图像分割任务中的鲁棒性和准确性。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，通过引入自适应卷积模块的MSA2-Net显著提高了在多个医学图像数据集上的分割准确性，展现出了强大的泛化能力。

**Abstract:** The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有LVLM令牌压缩方法存在位置偏倚和不兼容高效算子的问题，影响了其在加速LVLM方面的实际部署。

**Method:** 通过分析，提出了一种从令牌变化角度出发的方法，即变化感知视觉令牌丢弃（V$^2$Drop），它通过在LVLM推理过程中逐步移除变化小的视觉令牌来提升计算效率。

**Result:** 实验表明V$^2$Drop在图像和视频理解任务上保持了94.0%和98.6%的原始模型性能，同时分别减少了31.5%和74.2%的LLM生成延迟，并与高效算子结合进一步降低GPU峰值内存使用。

**Conclusion:** V$^2$Drop方法展现了显著的计算效率提升和低影响性能损失，证明了其在LVLM加速方面的有效性。

**Abstract:** Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

**Motivation:** 由于现有的视觉语言模型在像诊断放射学这样高风险领域缺乏区分精确性，且公开可用的体积CT数据集稀缺和异质，本文旨在通过新方法改善这些问题。

**Method:** 本文介绍了一种名为Uniferum的体积视觉语言模型，该模型将分类标签和分割掩模等多种监督信号统一到一个训练框架中，以提升模型在医学成像中的性能。

**Result:** 与CLIP基础模型和传统的多标签卷积模型相比，Uniferum在CT-RATE基准测试中的AUROC提高了7%。该模型还展示了在RAD-CHEST和INSPECT数据集上的零样本性能。

**Conclusion:** 本文的研究成果展示了一个新方向，即通过整合异质注释和身体分割来增强视觉语言模型在临床可靠性和数据有效性方面的表现。

**Abstract:** General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

**Conclusion:** 这项工作提出了ReVPT方法，通过强化学习改进多模态模型的视觉工具使用与推理能力，实现了在视觉推理任务上的新性能高度，并为社区带来了关于强化学习视觉工具使用的深入见解。代码已开源。

**Abstract:** Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the
instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the
community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有技术在使用超声引导高强度聚焦超声治疗时，常常受到干扰的影响，限制了治疗的成功率和安全性。为了克服这一挑战，提出了HIFU-ILDiff方法。

**Method:** HIFU-ILDiff采用Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder（VQ-VAE）将有噪声的超声图像编码为低维度潜在空间，并用潜扩散模型逐步去除干扰，从而重构出清晰无干扰的超声图像。

**Result:** 该方法基于18,872个图像对的数据集进行训练和验证，结果表明HIFU-ILDiff在结构相似性指数（SSIM）和峰值信噪比（PSNR）上明显优于传统Notch Filter方法，并实现了每秒15帧的实时处理能力。

**Conclusion:** 通过HIFU-ILDiff，可以有效滤除高强度聚焦超声治疗中的干扰，提高实时监控超声图像的质量，有助于提升临床应用中治疗的精确度。

**Abstract:** High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

**Motivation:** 现有的模型在处理视频内容时难以平衡空间分辨率和时间覆盖率，特别是在视频理解这一领域。

**Method:** 我们提出了Keye-VL-1.5模型，通过三种创新方法解决了视频理解中的基本挑战：1. 提出了一种新的慢速-快速视频编码策略，根据帧间相似性动态分配计算资源；2. 实现了渐进的四阶段预训练方法，逐步扩展模型上下文长度，从而处理更长和更复杂的视频内容；3. 开发了一种全面的后训练流程，重点关注推理增强和对人体偏好的对齐。

**Conclusion:** Keye-VL-1.5在视频理解任务中表现出明显优势，同时在其他多模态任务中也保持了良好的性能。

**Abstract:** In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization

catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

**Conclusion:** 该论文展示了Panel-of-Peers方法在增强LVLMs模型的对齐表现上是有效的，并且可以引导更广泛的应用和实验，减少了对人力标注数据和自我监督对齐方式的依赖。

**Abstract:** Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

### [289] [Q-Sched: Pushing the Boundaries of Few-Step Diffusion Models with Quantization-Aware Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01624)
*Natalia Frumkin,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

> Q-Sched, a new method for post-training quantization, modifies diffusion schedulers, not weights. It reduces model size fourfold while improving image quality significantly compared to floating-point models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this research is to address the computational inefficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, particularly around the high cost of large model evaluations. By focusing on innovations around the scheduler and introducing efficient tuning through JAQ loss, the authors aim to make diffusion models more accessible and less resource-intensive.

**Method:** The paper introduces Q-Sched, a novel post-training quantization technique that alters the scheduler of diffusion models instead of the model weights, aiming to reduce model size significantly while retaining full-precision accuracy. Additionally, the JAQ loss function is proposed to optimize the quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients using a combination of text-image compatibility and image quality metrics, requiring minimal calibration prompts and avoiding full-precision inference during the process.

**Result:** Q-Sched yields a 4x reduction in model size and achieves substantial performance improvements: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16 4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step Phased Consistency Model. A large-scale user study supports its effectiveness.

**Conclusion:** Q-Sched not only reduces the computational cost and size of diffusion models but also enhances image quality and performance, making high-fidelity image generation more accessible and efficient. The effectiveness and efficiency of Q-Sched are validated through both quantitative metrics and large-scale user studies.

**Abstract:** Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

Main category: cs.CV

> OpenVision 2 simplifies the original model by removing unnecessary components, achieving comparable performance with reduced resource consumption and a higher scalability potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance training efficiency of OpenVision by simplifying its architecture and loss design.

**Method:** This paper simplifies the architecture and loss design of OpenVision by removing the text encoder and contrastive loss, focusing only on captioning loss.

**Result:** OpenVision 2 matches the original model's performance on multimodal benchmarks while reducing training time by 1.5x and memory usage by 1.8x.

**Conclusion:** The simplified version, OpenVision 2, showcases improved efficiency which allows for scaling beyond the original vision encoder limitations.

**Abstract:** This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

**Motivation:** 当前技术在渲染逼真人像时存在模糊问题。为解决这一问题，作者提出了GaussianGAN，旨在提供一种无模糊、可动画化的逼真人像渲染方法。

**Method:** 作者使用了一种新的基于高斯喷涂的稠密化策略来构建高斯点，同时结合了一个视图分割模块来生成语义分割，最后利用一个UNet生成器来综合生成逼真的数字角色。

**Conclusion:** GaussianGAN不仅在实时渲染速度上达到了79 FPS，而且在视觉感知和质量上也优于先前方法，实现了逼真角色渲染的全新技术水平。

**Abstract:** Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and
33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges of high dimensionality and complexity in feature extraction for multi-label classification of multispectral images, and to assess the benefits of incorporating PCA as a preprocessing step.

**Method:** A pipeline is developed including an optional PCA step to reduce the data to three dimensions, followed by classification with a three-layer classifier using ResNet50 and DINOv2.

**Result:** The results indicate that the utility of PCA varies significantly with the deep learning architecture and the training strategy used.

**Conclusion:** Future research should focus on self-supervised pre-training and alternative methods for dimensionality reduction to optimize PCA's utility in multi-label classification of multispectral images.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

**Abstract:** Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

**Motivation:** 为了解决由于截断投影造成的有限角度计算机断层扫描(LACT)中严重伪影的问题。

**Method:** 该方法提出了一种由结构化临床元数据引导的两阶段扩散框架。包括利用基于Transformer的扩散模型从噪声生成粗略的解剖学先验，以及通过数据整合进行高保真度图像的进一步细化。

**Result:** 本研究针对由于截断投影导致的严重伪影，提出了一种基于两阶段扩散框架的解决方案，该框架由结构化临床元数据引导。第一阶段采用仅基于元数据（如采集参数、患者人口统计学和诊断印象）的基于Transformer的扩散模型，从噪声中生成粗糙的解剖学先验。第二阶段通过结合粗糙先前知识和元数据进一步细化生成高保真度结果。研究显示，使用元数据辅助的数据一致性约束显著提高了重建精度，特别是在严重角度截断的情况下。实验表明，相比于无元数据的基本线模型，该方法在SSIM、PSNR、nMI、PCC等指标上表现更优。消融研究证明，不同类型的数据贡献了互补的好处。这些结果突显了将临床元数据用于未来医疗成像框架中的重要性。

**Conclusion:** 临床元数据的使用可以显著提高图像重建的质量和效率，并且在不同程度的局限角度条件下，不同类型的数据发挥了互补作用。

**Abstract:** Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

*Yifan Lan,Xin Cai,Jun Cheng,Shan Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

> The paper introduces Balanced Information Bottleneck (BIB) and a mixture of multiple BIBs (MBIB) to enhance the performance of Deep Neural Networks on long-tailed visual recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on several datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the challenge of long-tailed distributions in real-world visual recognition data that poses difficulties for Deep Neural Network (DNN) training and deployment.

**Method:** The paper proposes a Balanced Information Bottleneck (BIB) approach that integrates loss function re-balancing and self-distillation into the original Information Bottleneck (IB) network, designed to handle long-tailed data effectively. Additionally, a mixture of multiple BIBs (MBIB) structure is introduced, where different BIB components combine knowledge from various network layers to enhance representation learning.

**Result:** Experiments on datasets such as CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018 demonstrate that BIB and MBIB achieve state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition tasks.

**Conclusion:** The introduction of BIB and MBIB offers better performance for long-tailed visual recognition by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the models in learning from imbalanced datasets.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

> PractiLight is a practical method to effectively control light in generated images by using a lightweight model to produce direct irradiance maps, leveraging self-attention layer insights. It outperforms existing approaches in both quality and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to develop a practical approach, PractiLight, that doesn't depend on extensive and domain-specific datasets, thereby enhancing the generalization and applicability of the foundational models used for image light control.

**Method:** The method involves training a lightweight LoRA regressor to produce the direct irradiance map based on the insight that lighting relationships in images are similar to token interactions in self-attention layers. The regressor is then used to incorporate desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier Guidance.

**Result:** The result demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in terms of both quality and control while maintaining efficiency in terms of parameters and data over a wide variety of scene types.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that image lighting can feasibly be controlled effectively by integrating foundational knowledge, particularly pertaining to self-attention mechanics, allowing for practical and adaptable relighting solutions.

**Abstract:** Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的空间转录组学数据模型在从组织病理学图像预测空间解析的基因表达时面临显著的数据丢失问题。现有方法依赖于单细胞RNA测序参考而导致数据对齐质量问题和批次效应。

**Method:** 引入LGDiST，这是一种无参考的潜在基因扩散模型，专门用于解决空间转录组学数据中的数据丢失问题。

**Result:** LGDiST在基因表达的完整性方面优于以往的最优方法，其平均均方误差（MSE）降低了18%，并且通过使用LGDiST补全空间转录组学数据可以改善六种现有最优方法的基因表达预测性能，至多可降低10%的MSE。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，LGDiST的完整架构在性能上显著优于其任何单独的组成部分。这说明了LGDiST模型在处理空间转录组学数据缺失问题上的有效性。

**Abstract:** Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

> This paper evaluates the practical deployment of federated learning for object detection in CAVs, addressing key challenges and analyzing trade-offs under diverse conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the challenges in deploying FL for object detection in CAVs, including heterogeneity, constrained computing hardware, and environmental variability.

**Method:** Content analyzes the challenges in deploying federated learning (FL) for object detection in Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and evaluates performance, resource usage, and environmental robustness using state-of-the-art detectors and diverse datasets.

**Result:** The work integrates model performance, system-level resource profiling, and environmental robustness, analyzing trade-offs under diverse conditions.

**Conclusion:** This study provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for FL-based object detection in CAVs, which is crucial for robust deployment.

**Abstract:** Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

**Abstract:** Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

**Conclusion:** 尽管当前模型优化适用于光照良好的图像，未来的改进将专注于提高在低光和障碍条件下的鲁棒性，以扩大其应用范围。

**Abstract:** Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于野火的强度和频率不断上升，亟需创新计算方法以便快速准确评估财产损坏状况。传统方法通常耗时较长，而现代计算机视觉方法通常需要大量标记数据集，这阻碍了灾难发生后的即时部署。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种新颖的零样本框架，利用预训练的视觉语言模型（VLM）从地面图像中分类火灾损坏情况。并评估了两种管道，在2025年加利福尼亚的Eaton和Palisades火灾中分别应用了VLM（管道A）和VLM+大型语言模型（LLM）方法（管道B），它们集成了基于具体野火损坏指标的结构化提示输入。

**Result:** 研究发现，单视角评估难以分类受损结构（F1得分在0.225到0.511之间），而多视角分析则显著提升（F1得分在0.857到0.947之间）。另外，麦尼玛尔检验确认了基于多视角图像评估的管道在分类上显著提升；然而，本研究中管道A和B之间的改进并不具有统计学显著性。

**Conclusion:** 主要的科学贡献在于展示了VLMs在综合多重视角信息以识别精细损坏方面的有效性，这是现有文献中的一个重要局限性。实践贡献是一个立即可部署、灵活以及可解释的工作流程，绕过了监督训练的需要，大大加快了灾难响应者的分类优先级。

**Abstract:** The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

**Motivation:** 现有的地理定位模型如GeoCLIP虽能实现精确的图像-位置匹配，但其解释性不足。现有基于概念的解释方法难以与图像-位置嵌入目标对齐，导致解释性差。

**Method:** 研究中提出的方法通过插入一个概念感知对齐模块，将图像和位置嵌入投影到共享的地理概念银行中，并在概念级别最小化损失，以增强在特定概念子空间的对齐。

**Conclusion:** 这是首次将可解释性引入地理定位领域的工作，揭示了地理决策过程中的丰富语义洞察。

**Abstract:** Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the limitation of multimodal models like CLIP when dealing with specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which have distinct structured information compared to natural imagery.

**Method:** The proposed method involves using ``hard'' samples for contrastive learning with two specialised loss functions that leverage the structural properties of diagrams, integrating these into model training to improve comprehension of diagrammatic images.

**Result:** The approach shows substantial improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks on a flowchart dataset.

**Conclusion:** The findings highlight the importance of tailored training strategies for specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within vision-language integration.

**Abstract:** Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

**Result:** 在标准基准上的大量实验表明，该方法在定量指标和感知质量方面均取得了有竞争力的表现。

**Conclusion:** 基于2D高斯散斑的图像修复方法为2D图像处理领域开辟了新的方向。

**Abstract:** Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

**Abstract:** Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

**Motivation:** 多主体个性化生成在合成图像时保持主体身份保真性和连贯性方面面临挑战，现有方法容易出现身份混合和属性泄露的问题。MOSAIC的动机是提高多主体图像生成的一致性和保真度。

**Abstract:** Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper aims to explore the text-to-image editing capabilities of VAR models without requiring further training. This technique promises practical benefits for real-world applications where prompt-guided image editing is essential.

**Method:** VARIN (Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise) is introduced as a noise inversion-based editing technique specifically for VAR models. It uses a new pseudo-inverse function, Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises for precise image reconstruction and editing based on text prompts.

**Result:** Experiments confirm that VARIN can modify images according to text prompts while preserving the original background and structural details, demonstrating its practical value.

**Conclusion:** VARIN proves effective for text-to-image editing in VAR models, offering a practical solution for real-world applications that require precise and controlled image modifications based on textual guidance.

**Abstract:** Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

> 针对现有模型在图像编辑方面的不足，我们引入了包含14M图像-文本对和233K设计蓝图的数据集DIM，并通过该数据集训练得到的模型DIM-4.6B-Edit在多个基准测试中表现出色，证明了明确分配设计任务给理解模块对图像编辑的巨大好处。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 为了解决现有的多模态理解和生成单体模型在精确图像编辑方面的局限性，我们引入了Draw-In-Mind (DIM) 数据集，以改善模型对设计部分的理解。

**Method:** 我们引入了Draw-In-Mind (DIM) 数据集，包括两个互补的数据子集：(i) DIM-T2I，包含14M长上下文图像-文本对，以增强复杂指令的理解；(ii) DIM-Edit，包括233K由GPT-4o生成的链式思考想象图，作为图像编辑的明确设计蓝图。通过将一个冻结的Qwen2.5-VL-3B与一个可训练的SANA1.5-1.6B连接起来，并在提议的DIM数据集上训练，得到了DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit模型。

**Result:** 尽管参数规模较小，DIM-4.6B-Edit在ImgEdit和GEdit-Bench基准上实现了SOTA或具有竞争力的表现，超过了更大规模的模型如UniWorld-V1和Step1X-Edit。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，明确分配设计任务给理解模块在图像编辑上提供了显著的提升。我们的数据集和模型将在https://github.com/showlab/DIM公开。

**Abstract:** In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

**Abstract:** In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous
driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and
methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of
more interpretable AI systems.

> An innovative Palette-Adapter technique is introduced to enable more stable and accurate color palette conditioning in text-to-image diffusion models, enhancing image quality and palette adherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Palettes, while intuitive and compact, introduce ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning in image generation. Our goal was to develop a method that could address these challenges and ensure stable, semantically coherent image generation.

**Method:** Our method involves introducing the Palette-Adapter, a novel technique conditioning text-to-image models with user-defined color palettes. We interpret these palettes as sparse histograms and introduce two scalar control parameters: histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance. A negative histogram mechanism is also implemented to suppress undesired hues.

**Result:** Qualitative, quantitative evaluations, and user studies demonstrate consistent outperformance over existing methods in achieving both high palette adherence and image quality across various palettes and prompts.

**Conclusion:** The Palette-Adapter method allows for the use of user-specified color palettes in text-to-image generation with improved stability and flexibility, outperforming previous methods in both adherence to the palette and overall image quality.

**Abstract:** We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

**Motivation:** 早产儿监护依赖人工观察或侵入性传感器，这些都是有误差的且不切实际的方式，还可能造成皮肤损伤。这项研究的动机在于解决资源有限的环境中早产儿监护的需求。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种新颖的，非侵入性的，基于视觉的自动化监测框架来解决当前监护难题。该系统使用了部署在树莓派上的量化MobileNet模型来进行婴儿行为状态的实时检测。通过使用量化处理，模型大小减少了68%，并优化了树莓派上的视觉处理管线，同时整合了安全的物联网通信来提供临床警报。

**Result:** 该系统在公共早产儿图像数据集上进行了训练和评估，实现了最先进的准确率（睡眠行为检测准确率为91.8%，哭声/正常状态分类准确率为97.7%），同时保持了适合边缘部署的计算效率。

**Conclusion:** 该研究工作明确展示了轻量级的优化模型（如MobileNet）为可扩展、低成本和具有临床应用可行性的新生儿监护系统提供了一个最可行的基础，这为资源受限环境下的早产儿护理改进铺平了道路。

**Abstract:** Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

**Motivation:** The motivation is to explore the effect of synthetic hard negative samples in the context of vision transformers, as previous works have rarely considered this.

**Method:** The method involves integrating synthetic hard negatives into self-supervised learning to improve the discriminative power of the learned representations in vision transformers.

**Result:** The result is an improvement in performance for both DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures in the experiments conducted.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that incorporating synthetic hard negatives can effectively enhance the performance of vision transformers by strengthening their ability to distinguish between different features.

**Abstract:** This paper does not introduce a novel method per se. Instead, we address the
neglected potential of hard negative samples in self-supervised learning.
Previous works explored synthetic hard negatives but rarely in the context of
vision transformers. We build on this observation and integrate synthetic hard
negatives to improve vision transformer representation learning. This simple

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文旨在评估RMOT系统的安全漏洞，并从设计原理出发，通过实验揭示了RMOT系统中的语言视觉参照和目标匹配组件存在的对抗性漏洞。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种名为VEIL的对抗框架，能够通过精心设计的扰动来干扰RMOT模型的统一引用匹配机制，从而导致跟踪ID的切换或终止。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，在Refer-KITTI数据集上，VEIL对抗框架能有效干扰RMOT模型的跟踪逻辑，证明了安全设计的紧迫性。

**Conclusion:** 本文通过VEIL框架展现了RMOT模型中的安全漏洞，强调了在设计大规模关键应用时需具备安全意识的重要性。

**Abstract:** Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

*Pinzhuo Tian,Shengjie Yang,Hang Yu,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

> 本文针对slot attention方法的两个局限性，提出了新的方法ContextFusion和Bootstrap Branch，实验验证了该方法能显著提高模型在理解和重建场景中对象的能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于现有的slot attention方法在理解和捕捉对象的边界、形状等语义特征方面存在局限性，并且受限于固定的特征空间，无法很好地进行特征适应。为了解决这些问题，从而提升模型理解和重建场景中的对象的能力，我们提出了新的方法。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种新的ContextFusion阶段和Bootstrap Branch，可以无缝集成到现有的slot attention模型中，以解决slot attention方法的两大局限性。在ContextFusion阶段，我们利用了前景和背景的语义信息，并引入了一个辅助指示器，为slot提供额外的上下文线索，从而丰富了语义内容而不仅仅是低层次特征。在Bootstrap Branch中，我们解耦了特征适应与原始重建阶段，并引入了一个引导策略，训练出一个特征自适应机制，提升了模型的灵活性。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，本方法显著提升了不同前沿slot attention模型在模拟和真实世界数据集上的性能。

**Conclusion:** 通过引入ContextFusion阶段和Bootstrap Branch，我们有效地改善了现有的slot attention方法的局限性，提升了模型的理解和重建能力，特别是在语义内容的理解和特征的灵活适应方面。

**Abstract:** A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

**Motivation:** 传统的行人属性识别方法受限于训练数据集中的某些属性代表性不足的问题，因此本文旨在通过合成数据增强来解决这些问题，提升模型性能。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种基于合成数据增强的行人属性识别方法，该方法由三个步骤构成：首先确定弱识别属性；其次通过提示驱动流水线生成合成图像；最后制定策略将合成样本与训练数据融合，改善了传统的行人属性识别任务。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，本文的方法不仅提升了被低估属性的识别表现，也增强了模型的零样本泛化能力，改善了整体模型的表现。

**Conclusion:** 本文提出的方法是一种提高行人属性识别有效性和可扩展性的解决方案，其展示了在无需改变模型架构的前提下显著改善行人属性识别性能的潜力。

**Abstract:** Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的逻辑异常检测方法依赖于预先训练的特征或手工制作的描述符，这会导致性能下降，因为它们忽略了空间和语义信息。因此，为了改进这一不足，提出了这个新的研究。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种名为SALAD的新方法，它使用一个新提出的成分分支来明确建模对象成分图的分布，从而学习重要的语义关系。此外，还介绍了一种提取成分图的新流程，不需要手工标签或特定类别的信息。

**Result:** SALAD在标准逻辑异常检测基准MVTec LOCO上表现出色，取得了96.1%的图像级AUROC得分。

**Conclusion:** SALAD解决了现有方法在逻辑异常检测中的不足，通过引入新的模型成分分支和新的成分图提取流程显著提高了性能。

**Abstract:** Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation for NOOUGAT stems from the need to bridge the gap between online and offline MOT approaches, which have traditionally provided fragmented solutions unsuitable for flexible real-world deployment scenarios.

**Method:** The paper introduces NOOUGAT, a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) method that operates with arbitrary temporal horizons. NOOUGAT uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to process non-overlapping subclips and fuses these through an Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer, allowing flexible control over latency and temporal context.

**Result:** NOOUGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance across both online and offline tracking modes. It shows significant improvements in AssA, including +5.0 on MOT20, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +2.3 on DanceTrack, particularly excelling in offline tracking scenarios.

**Conclusion:** The introduction of NOOUGAT demonstrates the potential of unified approaches to Multi-Object Tracking that can adapt to varying temporal requirements, offering a robust solution for real-world deployment with state-of-the-art performance.

**Abstract:** The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.
