Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure.

We introduce\nResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles\nfrom 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric,\nderived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer\nevaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing\nlimitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of\nqueries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be\naddressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are\nable to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with\nexpert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18\nsystems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented\nsystem we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the\nhighest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that\nthe highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric\nitems, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items.

Through our AI-assisted data\npipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated\nsamples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times\nthe number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a\ntriplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected\nresponse. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal\nreward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and\nsemi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves\nonly 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model\nQwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key\ninsights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily\nexhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)\nexcept for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model\ncapacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in\ninput video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We\nbelieve VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for\nadvancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "提出了VideoRewardBench，一个全面的视频领域多模态奖励模型（MRMs）评估基准，包含高质量的数据集，并对28种模型进行了评估，展示了其在评估和推进MRMs开发方面的潜力。", "motivation": "现有的用于评估视频领域多模态奖励模型（MRMs）的基准测试存在样本数量和多样性不足、评估维度不全面以及无法充分评估各种类型MRMs的问题。为了填补这些空白，引入了VideoRewardBench。", "method": "提出了VideoRewardBench，这是一个全面的基准测试，涵盖了视频理解的四个方面：感知、知识、推理和安全。通过AI辅助的数据管道，我们策划了一个高质量的偏好数据集，包含1,563个标注样本，包括1,482个唯一的视频和1,559个独特的问题，是之前问题最多的基准测试中的15倍。每个样本由一个视频-文本提示、一个选定的响应和一个被拒绝的响应组成。", "result": "对涵盖三个类别的28个多模态奖励模型进行了全面评估，结果显示，即使是表现最好的模型GPT-4o的总体准确率也仅为57.0%，最先进的开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B的准确率也只有53.3%。", "conclusion": "分析表明，通过引入VideoRewardBench，可以为推进视频领域的MRMs评估和技术发展提供一个具有挑战性和价值的测试基准。"}}

Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract\nnews semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,\nstylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues\ncan easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in\ndynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news\nlandscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective\nby incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and\nsemantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one\ncan deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than\nthe surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose\nGraph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,\nwhich models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via\ngraph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and\nintent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context\ninteraction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and\nimplementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling.

Object-centric learning aims\nto mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot\nattention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and\nhas been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot\nattention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic\ninformation. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on\nlow-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly\nsensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object\ncontours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to\nfine-tune the encoder.
