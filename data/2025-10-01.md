### [1] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

> 通过循环消融尝试消除DistilGPT-2中的欺骗行为未成功，但发现欺骗行为高度鲁棒，且编辑过程导致语言能力下降。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 探讨大型语言模型中的不良行为（如欺骗）是否为可以删除的局部功能，还是与模型的核心认知能力深度交织。

**Method:** 引入了“循环消融”方法，结合稀疏自动编码器、针对性消融及对DistilGPT-2的对抗性训练，尝试消除欺骗概念。

**Result:** 发现欺骗行为高度鲁棒，模型通过对抗性训练在每次消融周期后都能恢复其欺骗行为，同时整体语言表现逐渐下降。

**Conclusion:** 结果表明复杂概念是分布与纠缠的，强调了通过机制性可解释性直接编辑模型的能力有限。

**Abstract:** Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

### [2] [From Internal Representations to Text Quality: A Geometric Approach to LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25359)
*Viacheslav Yusupov,Danil Maksimov,Ameliia Alaeva,Anna Vasileva,Anna Antipina,Tatyana Zaitseva,Alina Ermilova,Evgeny Burnaev,Egor Shvetsov*

Main category: cs.CL

> The paper proposes using geometric properties of internal model representations as reliable proxies for evaluating the quality of generated text, demonstrating that Intrinsic Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments without requiring human-annotated datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To bridge internal and external analysis approaches of large language models (LLMs) and propose a reference-free text quality evaluation method.

**Method:** Validation of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance, Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms across different LLM layers.

**Result:** Consistent ranking of text from various sources using geometric properties, indicating these metrics reflect inherent text qualities.

**Conclusion:** Geometric properties like Intrinsic Dimensionality and Effective Rank offer practical advantages for automated and reference-free quality evaluation in LLMs.

**Abstract:** This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

### [3] [Generative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25369)
*Andy Liu,Kshitish Ghate,Mona Diab,Daniel Fried,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.CL

> 引入了自动评估流程ConflictScope，以评估大语言模型在价值冲突情境中的表现，并发现通过系统提示可以改善模型的行为一致性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 存在对价值冲突的评估数据集稀缺的问题，作者提出ConflictScope以评估LLM如何在实际使用中权衡不同的价值观。

**Method:** 介绍了一种名为ConflictScope的自动流程，用于评估LLM在面对价值冲突时如何优先考虑不同的价值观。该流程根据用户定义的价值观集，自动生成LLM面临价值冲突的情境。通过LLM撰写的“用户提示”来提示目标模型，并评估它们的文本响应，从而提取出价值集中的价值观的排序。

**Result:** 比较了多项选择评估和开放式评估之间的结果，发现模型在更加开放的价值冲突情况下，从支持保护性价值观（如无害性）转向了支持个人价值观（如用户自主权）。然而，将详细的价值排序包含在模型的系统提示中可以将与目标排序的一致性提高14%。

**Conclusion:** 该工作展示了评估模型中的价值优先级的重要性，并为该领域未来的探索提供了一定基础。

**Abstract:** Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

### [4] [From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25409)
*Qiyao Ma,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Chao Wang,Weiming Chang,Ting Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了TRM模型，该模型通过引入句子级别的思考监督，提升了模型在复杂任务中的批评性评估能力，从而提高了回答的正确性和实用性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）在复杂任务如开放领域的问答上面临挑战，因为难以验证回答的正确性。现有工作主要集中在提高忠实度上，这使得模型过度依赖外部信息，减少了它们的批判性评估能力。

**Method:** 通过引入思考监督奖励模型（TRM），该方法首先评估答案句子对支持文档的忠实度，然后评估句子级别的正确性。TRM 将奖励建模结构化为忠实度、推理和正确性评估的序列，从而鼓励模型批判性地评估和利用外部和内部知识。

**Result:** 实验表明，TRM 大幅提高了对错误句子的识别，并且在策略优化中引入 TRM 可以显著提高答案的正确性和实用性。

**Conclusion:** TRM 方法通过引入批判性思维能力，提高了模型在复杂任务中评估和利用知识的能力。

**Abstract:** Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

### [5] [Emotion-Aligned Generation in Diffusion Text to Speech Models via Preference-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25416)
*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Yangfan He,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

> The paper introduces EASPO, a post-training framework for enhancing emotional text-to-speech that improves expressiveness and naturalness over existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve emotional text-to-speech by addressing the limitations of existing methods which rely on coarse labels or proxy classifiers and only receive utterance-level feedback.

**Method:** Central to the approach is EASPM, a time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match these stepwise preferences.

**Result:** Experiments demonstrated superior performance in both expressiveness and naturalness compared to existing methods.

**Conclusion:** The introduced Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO) framework allows for better emotional shaping in text-to-speech generation, enhancing both expressiveness and naturalness.

**Abstract:** Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

### [6] [SimulRAG: Simulator-based RAG for Grounding LLMs in Long-form Scientific QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25459)
*Haozhou Xu,Dongxia Wu,Matteo Chinazzi,Ruijia Niu,Rose Yu,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了SimulRAG框架，通过结合科学模拟器与检索增强生成技术提高长篇科学问题回答的准确性和可信度，并设计了UE+SBA方法评估和更新生成的陈述。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 动机在于解决大型语言模型在生成长篇科学答案问题时出现的幻觉问题，并提升答案的事实性和可信度。

**Method:** 提出SimulRAG框架和UE+SBA方法，该框架包括通用科学模拟器检索接口以及基于不确定性估计和模拟器边界评估的生成方法。

**Result:** 实验表明SimulRAG框架在信息量和准确性方面比传统RAG基线性能提高了30.4%和16.3%，UE+SBA进一步提高了生成效率和质量。

**Conclusion:** 该研究为科学问题的长篇回答提供了一种更准确可靠的方法，证明了科学模拟器作为外部知识来源的有效性。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

### [8] [Not Wrong, But Untrue: LLM Overconfidence in Document-Based Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25498)
*Nick Hagar,Wilma Agustianto,Nicholas Diakopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究评估了在基于新闻报道任务中，大型语言模型LLMs（如ChatGPT，Gemini和NotebookLM）的幻觉倾向，并指出幻觉生成率较高，且存在解释过度自信的问题。这揭示了模型和新闻业在事实来源上的根本差异。建议开发专为准确归因设计的架构以优化新闻室工具。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 鉴于大型语言模型在新闻工作流中的应用日益增加，但幻觉倾向对新闻业的核心实践构成了风险，故研究旨在评估这些模型在新闻报道任务中的表现，并提出针对性改进。

**Method:** 研究使用基于美国TikTok诉讼和政策的300文档相关语料库，评估了ChatGPT, Gemini 和 NotebookLM，根据不同提示的特异性及上下文长度的变更，并通过分类法评估句子级别输出的幻觉类型和严重程度。

**Result:** 结果显示，采样中有30%的模型输出包含至少一个幻觉，其中Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉频率约为NotebookLM的三倍。大量的错误表现为对源材料的解释过度自信，而非虚构实体或数字。

**Conclusion:** 研究强调了LLMs和新闻业在知识获取上的基础差异，并提出需要基于准确归因的架构来改进新闻室中使用的工具，而不仅仅是提升语言流畅度。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

### [9] [Beyond WER: Probing Whisper's Sub-token Decoder Across Diverse Language Resource Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25516)
*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究揭示资源丰富语言在解码正确性、预测置信度和候选多样性方面优于资源贫乏语言，后者则显示出不同的子词使用模式。这表明系统解码存在不平衡，需采取针对性措施。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 深入了解大语言模型的内部机制，特别是在不同语言上的公平性和有效性。

**Method:** Whisper的多语言解码器的细粒度分析，追踪转录过程中各语言的子词假设及其概率。

**Result:** 高资源语言的正确词可能性更高、自信度更高、预测熵更低且备选词更多样化；低资源语言则较差，但显示出独特的子词使用聚类模式。

**Conclusion:** 此子词探测揭示了隐藏在聚合错误率背后的系统性解码差异，并指明了平衡语音技术发展的干预方法。

**Abstract:** While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

Main category: cs.CL

> MixtureVitae是一套开源的预训练语料库，旨在通过采用风险缓释的数据来源策略，减少法律风险，同时保持强大的模型性能。该方法通过细致的数据处理和透明化的构建流程，展现出了相较于其他开源数据集较强的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 构建MixtureVitae的目标是减少法律风险，同时提供强大的模型性能。通过创建一个开放访问的预训练语料库来满足这一需求。

**Method:** MixtureVitae采用了一种风险缓释的来源策略，结合了公共领域的文本和许可协议宽松的文本（例如CC-BY/Apache），以及细致论证的低风险添加项（例如政府作品和欧盟TDM符合条件的资源），并加入了有针对性的指令、推理和合成数据，并提供详细的文档来源。构建了一个透明的、多阶段的管道，用于许可感知筛选、安全性和质量筛选以及领域感知混合。

**Result:** 在使用固定体系结构（参数130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B；训练预算50B和300B标记）的开源科学参考训练协议的受控实验中，基于MixtureVitae训练的模型在标准基准测试套件上一致超越其他许可协议宽松的数据集。特别是在1.7B/300B设置中，在训练后期阶段，表现超过了FineWeb-Edu并接近DCLM。在数学/代码和问答任务上的性能特别强。

**Conclusion:** 这表明，从首先考虑许可协议、风险缓释的角度出发的数据，为培训能够胜任的大规模语言模型提供了一个实际和合法规避风险的基础上，降低了对不加区别地从网络抓取数据的依赖，同时也不会牺牲竞争力。

**Abstract:** We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

### [11] [Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532)
*Victor Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种新的方法Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)，用于校准大型语言模型(LLM)的自信度估计，该方法优于Baseline，并在自信估计的饱和程度上提高了实用性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本研究的动机在于解决大型语言模型(LLM)输出的自信度估计的偏校准问题。这些问题表现为LLM在低准确度实例上却报告高自信度，损害了用户对系统的信任和安全性。

**Method:** 我们引入了Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)，通过使模型独立地对几个自生成的干扰项（即替代性声明）进行自信评估，并通过总自信评估来规范化，来估计并考虑LLM的倾向性偏差。为了进一步提高校准，我们利用了生成器和验证器之间的不一致，并用一种基于一致性的生成器自信估计对该归一化的验证器自信进行增强。

**Result:** 研究表明，DINCO提供了更能使用的自信度估计，并且即使加入了更多的采样，DINCO依然优于Baseline。具体来说，在10次推理调用下，DINCO的表现超过了自我一致性的100次调用。

**Conclusion:** 我们的研究验证了LLM在面对提供少量信息的声明时表现出更高的倾向性，并且提出了一种新的方法Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)，来提高自信评估的校准准确性。DINCO改进了自信估计的饱和程度，提供了更为实用的输出结果。

**Abstract:** Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

> 提出了一种名为自我奖励评分基线强化学习的方法，该方法能轻量、高效地训练大语言模型，并通过有限的数据达到超越现有模型的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究发现，模型自身作为评分工具并生成基于评分的奖励信号可以显著提高推理性能，且训练后的模型还能成为更强大的评分工具。这促使了该研究的进行。

**Method:** 通过自我奖励的评分基线强化学习方法在开放性推理任务中优化大语言模型的训练。这种方法使用模型本身作为评分工具，生成基于评分标准的奖励信号来改善推理性能。

**Result:** 提出的框架既轻量又高效，能在资源有限的情况下进行快速训练并超越基准。使用少量HealthBench Easy子集的数据即可使模型在HealthBench Hard上的表现超过GPT-5。对于能力较弱的模型，加入少量教师评分数据进一步提升性能。

**Conclusion:** 该研究表明自我奖励评分基线强化学习方法是实现高效且强大推理性能的有力工具，特别适用于资源受限的环境。

**Abstract:** Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

*Soumik Dey,William Gregory Sakas*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本研究提出了一种新的计算参数，用于量化孩子对命令式和陈述式语法形式的误解，并通过模拟验证了这一参数的有效性，支持了一种关于孩子语法习得阶段的说法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 基于Orfitelli和Hyams (2012)的观察，即年轻英语使用者常常由于表现的影响将命令式无主语表述错误地归类为陈述式表述，进而形成暂时的无主语语法。

**Method:** 提出了一种新的计算参数来测量这种误解，并将它整合进一个模拟的义务主语语法学习模型中。使用了Yang (2012)的变分学习者模型的改良版，该模型适用于超集-子集语言。

**Result:** 模拟实验支持了Orfitelli和Hyams的假设。

**Conclusion:** 这项研究概述了一个框架，用于在语法习得研究中整合计算模型以及其他关键的发展因素。

**Abstract:** The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文旨在解决现有基于Pearson的ρ和Kendall的τ的机器翻译元评估方法的局限性，并提出一种新的元评估指标以提高评估的准确性和鲁棒性。

**Method:** 本文介绍了Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP)，这是一种针对机器翻译（MT）的新颖的分段层面的元评估指标。PDP基于相关性度量，利用成对差异而非原始分数进行评估，改进了先前基于Pearson的ρ和Kendall的τ的元评估方法。

**Result:** 在WMT'24共享任务上的分析表明，PDP能够适当地排序哨兵评估指标，并且与人类错误权重的对齐程度优于先前的工作。对噪声注入的分析还证明了PDP对于随机噪声、段偏差和系统偏差具有鲁棒性，并显示了其对极端异常值的敏感性。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，PDP作为一种新的机器翻译元评估指标，能够更好地理解和对抗随机噪声、段偏差和系统偏差，并提供了对极端异常值的敏感性，从而可以更准确地评价机器翻译系统的性能。

**Abstract:** This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

**Motivation:** 视觉-语言模型在生成特定风格（如幽默或浪漫）的图片描述方面存在困难，而获取偏好数据的成本很高，限制了模型能力的探索。

**Method:** 通过研究少量视觉-语言模型对幽默和浪漫风格的对齐效率，以了解这些模型的性能极限，以及达到风格饱和所需最少偏好数量。

**Result:** 研究了小规模视觉-语言模型对幽默和浪漫风格对齐的数据效率。

**Conclusion:** 此方法帮助定义模型的性能极限，并确定实现风格饱和所需的最低偏好数据量，从而评估模型的能力和局限性。

**Abstract:** Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了无奖励指导（RFG）框架，解决了当前指导dLLMs推理过程中的挑战。该方法通过对比增强模型和参考模型的对数似然比来引导推理，并在多个基准测试中显示出显著的准确率提升。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 扩散大型语言模型（dLLMs）在大规模语言建模中表现出巨大潜力，但现有的过程奖励模型学习方法对dLLMs生成的部分遮蔽句子提出了挑战。因此，需要一种新的方法来引导dLLMs的推理过程。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种称为无奖励指导（RFG）的方法，用于在没有明确过程奖励的情况下引导dLLMs的推理轨迹。RFG的关键思想是通过增强模型和参考dLLMs的对数似然比来参数化过程奖励。增强模型可以通过强化学习（RL）或监督微调（SFT）后的现成dLLM获得。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，RFG在四个具有挑战性的数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，使用多种dLLM和不同微调方法，都能显著提高准确率，最高提升9.2%。

**Conclusion:** 这些结果确立了RFG作为一个无需训练的通用框架，可以在测试时扩展推理，而无需依赖外部奖励模型。

**Abstract:** Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

**Motivation:** 探究变换器架构的表达能力，理解其在处理任意数量的上下文令牌时的能力，并通过数学手段解析变换器模型在处理概率测度映射时的性质，进一步扩展变换器模型的应用场景。

**Method:** 通过将神经网络建模为概率测度上的映射，研究变换器模型的普遍逼近性质，特别是关注变换器模型作为上下文映射的特性，并证明了变换器模型能够近似表示满足特定条件的映射，如保持支撑集基数和其Fréchet导数的正则部分均匀连续。通过此方法，证明了Vlasov方程的解可以由变换器模型近似表示，进一步证明了无限深度的平均场测度变换器可以与Vlasov流相识别。

**Result:** 成功地表征了变换器模型作为概率测度映射的特性，并证明变换器模型能够近似表示某些特定条件下的映射，如Vlasov方程的解。

**Conclusion:** 变换器模型通过其作为上下文映射的能力，能够近似表示保持支撑集基数和均匀连续Fréchet导数正则部分的映射，并能够模拟Vlasov方程的解，从而揭示了变换器模型的强大表达能力和广泛应用前景。

**Abstract:** Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

**Motivation:** 研究旨在解决大规模测量新闻报道中的选择性和框架性偏见这一挑战。通过提供一个系统性研究媒体偏见的方法，有助于理解公众舆论是如何被塑造的。

**Method:** 此研究透过结合大规模语言模型与近实时新闻抓取技术，构建了一个结构化的新闻内容注解数据集。该数据集标注了包括政治倾向、语气、话题、文章类型和重大事件等多种维度，实现了对数百篇文章的每日分析。

**Result:** 建立了一个大型数据集和计算框架，能够对上百篇文章进行每日结构化注解，从句子级别、文章级别、发布者级别测量新闻报道中的偏见。此外，还提供了一个交互式网络平台用于数据探索。

**Conclusion:** 该研究创立了一种可用于大规模研究媒体偏见的可重复方法，并为未来的研究提供了实证资源。通过分析不同时间和发布者的数据集，揭示了新闻报道和偏见的有趣模式。

**Abstract:** Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

**Motivation:** 为了评估LLMs在魁北克法语法语中重要语法现象上的语言知识，特别强调了评估当前模型理解深度语义的能力。

**Method:** 通过创建1,761对最小对比对（从魁北克政府机构维护的官方在线资源中的句子手动修改而来），并由12名魁北克法语母语者注释这些对比对，以评估LLMs在魁北克法语法语语法现象上的语言知识。这些对比对按20种语言现象进行标注，评估通过观察每个最小对比对在每类中的概率分配率进行。

**Result:** 发现虽然语法能力与模型规模成正比，但所有评估的模型在需要深度语义理解的现象上持续失败，显示出关键限制及与人类性能的显著差距。

**Conclusion:** 尽管大型语言模型在评估大规模语料库时已经显示出一定能力，但在需要深度语义理解的语法现象上表现出明显的局限，表明了未来改进的方向。

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

**Motivation:** 研究基准的可靠性是因为可靠的基准对于可信的评估和有意义的进步是必要的。

**Method:** 从分布的角度研究了基准的可靠性，并引入了'基准和谐度'的概念，衡量模型在基准子领域上的表现分布是否均匀。

**Result:** 分析表明，不和谐的基准可能导致误导性的结果，因为总体准确性可能被特定子领域的表现所左右。例如，在ARC-Easy基准中，生物学概念的问题过多，忽视了地理、物理、化学和环境科学等其他关键子领域。

**Conclusion:** 建议在报告准确性的同时也报告和谐度，将评估从简单的性能平均数转变为更稳健的、分布可靠性的性能测量。

**Abstract:** Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 许多研究表明，语言模型中存在针对不同人口群体的各种偏见，从而放大歧视并损害公平性。现有参数调整的去偏见方法显著降低了文本连贯性和任务准确性。基于提示的去偏见方法，仅对预定义的触发词有效，无法解决模型参数中深层次嵌入的刻板联想。因此，需要一种新的去偏见框架来解决这些问题。

**Method:** 提出了一种新的去偏见框架BiasUnlearn，通过双重途径的无学习机制协调刻板印象的遗忘和反刻板印象的保留，并通过对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转。

**Result:** 在多个语言模型和各种评估基准上进行了广泛实验。结果表明，BiasUnlearn在减轻语言模型中的偏见的同时保留了语言模型的能力，并优于现有的方法。进一步的实验揭示了去偏见权重可以在不同模型变体之间转移，证实了偏见表示在预训练阶段成为根深蒂固，并且在微调阶段仍然存在。

**Conclusion:** BiasUnlearn框架有效减轻了语言模型中的偏见，同时保留了模型的核心能力，并展示了去偏见权重在不同模型变体之间的可转移性。

**Abstract:** Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

**Motivation:** 当前的大规模推理模型主要依赖于扩大训练数据集，涵盖多样化的数学问题和长链推理，这引发了是否LLMs真正掌握了数学概念和推理原则的疑问。相比之下，人类则倾向于将复杂问题分解为多个基本能力来解决。本文旨在沿袭这种思路，提出基础能力的评估新范式。

**Method:** 提出了一种新的评估数学基础能力的范式，将基础能力分为两大维度：(1) 四大数学领域（代数、几何、分析和拓扑）中的特定领域能力；(2) 不同层次的逻辑能力，包括概念理解、使用正式数学语言的多步推理和反例驱动的逆向推理。针对每个基础能力单元，提出了相应的训练和评估数据集，并进行广泛的实验研究不同基础能力如何影响其他能力，以探索激发所需特定基础能力的策略。

**Result:** 高级模型的评估和实验结果显示了在不同基础能力上的多种有趣发现和启示，包括模型在各种基础能力上的不同表现以及各基础能力之间的相互作用。

**Conclusion:** 研究强调了解耦合数学智能到基础组件的重要性，为模型认知提供了新的洞见，并指导了培训策略的发展，朝着更有效、可迁移和以认知为基础的"原子思考"范式迈进。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic
thinking".

**Conclusion:** 本文通过结合去标识化和HIPS理论，提出的方法能够实现合成文本生成的隐私保护和实用性的平衡，在高风险领域应用显示出潜力。

**Abstract:** Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this
work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text
generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes
to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and

**Abstract:** Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

**Abstract:** The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 检测社交媒体中的希望言论已成为促进积极对话和福祉的关键任务。本文旨在开发一种多语言、细粒度的希望言论检测模型，以改进积极内容的审核，并促进在线社区的支持性环境。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种基于机器学习的多语言多类别希望言论检测方法，主要应用于社交媒体中英语、乌尔都语和西班牙语的希望言论检测。该方法利用了XLM-RoBERTa模型来识别和分类三种不同的希望言论：泛化希望、现实希望和不切实际的希望。

**Result:** 该方法在PolyHope-M 2025共享任务的PolyHope数据集上进行了评估，跨所有语言均实现了有竞争力的性能，并在宏F1分数方面显著优于最先进的技术。

**Conclusion:** 这项工作致力于开发可以应用于改进积极内容审核和促进支持性在线社区的多语言、细粒度希望言论检测模型，并讨论了在低资源语言中检测希望言论所面临的挑战及改善泛化的可能性。

**Abstract:** The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based
models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to detect and categorize hope speech into
three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope.
Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all
languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech
detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation
and foster supportive online communities.

> 本文提出了TruthRL，一种通过强化学习直接优化大型语言模型准确性的通用框架。实验结果表明，与传统的强化学习方法相比，TruthRL能显著减少28.9%的虚假信息，并提高21.1%的准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型虽然在事实性问题回答上表现出色，但依然容易产生幻觉和虚假回答，特别是在需要超出其参数知识的信息任务中。现有的方法为了提高准确性，经常放大了幻觉问题，而那些鼓励放弃回答的方法又可能过于保守，牺牲了正确的答案。因此，需要一个新的方法来平衡这两者，从而提高模型的准确性。

**Method:** TruthRL是一种基于强化学习（RL）的通用框架，用于直接优化大型语言模型（LLMs）的准确性。它具体使用GRPO实现了TruthRL，奖励机制简单但有效，可以区分正确答案、虚假信息和不确定情况下的放弃回答。该方法通过提供正确答案或在不确定时选择放弃来减少虚假信息，从而提高准确性。

**Result:** 实验表明，TruthRL与传统的强化学习方法相比，可以显著减少28.9%的虚假信息，并提高21.1%的准确性。这种方法在准确性与不确定性之间取得了良好的平衡，并在各种骨干模型（如Qwen，Llama）的实验环境下表现出了优异的性能。

**Conclusion:** 通过引入TruthRL，我们展示了一个新的学习目标设计的重要性，它不仅仅是优化准确性，而是要平衡准确性与对未来不确定性的认识，目的是提高大型语言模型的准确性。这个方法对于开发更加可信的大型语言模型具有重要的意义。

**Abstract:** While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

### [30] [Assessing Algorithmic Bias in Language-Based Depression Detection: A Comparison of DNN and LLM Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25795)
*Obed Junias,Prajakta Kini,Theodora Chaspari*

Main category: cs.CL

> The study compares DNN and LLM for automated depression detection, applying fairness-aware methods. LLM outperforms DNN, especially in gender bias. Worst-group loss better mitigates bias for DNN, and ethical prompts help in gender disparity reduction but not in racial disparity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation of this paper is to investigate algorithmic bias related to gender and race/ethnicity in models used for automated depression detection and to explore methods to mitigate such bias.

**Method:** This paper compares DNN-based embeddings with few-shot learning approaches using large language models (LLMs) for automated depression detection. It applies fairness-aware loss functions to DNN models and explores different prompt framing and shot counts in LLMs to address bias.

**Result:** The LLMs outperform DNN-based models in depression classification, especially for underrepresented groups like Hispanic participants. LLMs show less gender bias, but racial disparities persist. The worst-group loss function yields a better balance between performance and fairness for DNN models.

**Conclusion:** LLMs offer better performance and reduced gender bias compared to DNN-based models, but racial disparities remain. The worst-group loss function is more effective at mitigating bias in DNN models than fairness-regularized loss function. Prompt framing can help reduce gender bias in 1-shot LLM settings, but increasing shot count doesn't further reduce disparities.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

impact of prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and other optimization techniques on
model performance. Our findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs in handling specialized knowledge tasks in low-resource languages,

**Abstract:** Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in
tasks such as multi-hop reasoning. However, global sensemaking-answering
questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,
Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and
retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time
compared to the baseline. Our code is available at

**Motivation:** 解决大型推理模型受过度思考问题的影响，现有解决方案往往因误罚关键探索标记或奖励部分冗余而失效。

**Method:** 提出DECS框架，包括解耦标记级别奖励机制和新颖的课程批量调度策略。

**Result:** 实验显示，DECS在七个基准测试中将推理标记数量减少了超过50%，同时保持或提高了性能。

**Conclusion:** 显著提高推理效率而不牺牲模型的推理能力。

**Abstract:** While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

**Motivation:** 早期研究发现，解释可能会让用户相信不正确的VLM预测。为了解决这种情况，这项研究提出了一种方法来改善用户适当依赖VLM预测的能力。

**Method:** 提出通过两个质量评分函数评估VLM生成解释的两个互补质量：视觉保真度和对比度。视觉保真度衡量解释与视觉上下文的忠实程度，对比度衡量解释识别模型预测与合理替代品之间差异视觉细节的程度。

**Result:** 在A-OKVQA 和 VizWiz任务上，这些质量评分函数比现有解释质量更好的校准了模型的正确性。用户实验发现，与VLM解释一起显示质量分数提高了用户预测VLM正确性的准确率11.1%，对错误预测错误信任的比率减少了15.4%。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现强调了解释质量分数在促进用户对VLM预测适当依赖的实用性。

**Abstract:** When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

**Motivation:** 解决大型语言模型在科学事实方面的虚构，这严重损害了它们的可信度。现有的基准测试无法提供细粒度的评估，因此需要新的解决方案。

**Method:** 通过引入名为ReFACT（Reddit虚假与正确文本）的基准，该基准包含1,001个专家标注的问题-回答对，这些对跨越多个科学领域，以检测科学虚构。该基准允许多阶段评估：（1）虚构检测；（2）错误精确定位；（3）纠正。通过此基准测试了9个最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）。

**Result:** 测试了9个最先进的大型语言模型，发现它们的性能有限（约50%的准确性）。即使是顶级模型如GPT-4也未能区分事实性的科学回答与虚构的回答。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明在特定领域的背景下检测和纠正科学虚构依然是一项挑战，需要更多细粒度且经过人类验证的基准测试。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently confabulate scientific facts,severely
undermining their trustworthiness. Addressing this challenge requires
benchmarks that go beyond binary factuality and enable fine-grained evaluation.
We introduce \textbf{ReFACT} (\textit{Reddit False And Correct Texts}), a

multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error
localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,
raising concerns about the reliability of \textit{LLM-as-judge} evaluation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To evaluate the contextual sensitivity of LLMs in complex social dilemmas through realistic role conflict scenarios.

**Method:** Developed a three-stage pipeline to generate over 13K scenarios across 65 roles, analyzing model choices across 10 different LLMs.

**Result:** LLMs show some contextual sensitivity but are primarily influenced by inherent biases toward roles in the Family and Occupation domains, male roles, and Abrahamic religions.

**Conclusion:** While LLMs have some ability to recognize contextual cues in role conflicts, this capability is limited and overshadowed by inherent biases related to social roles.

**Abstract:** Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

**Motivation:** 由于缺乏评估文本特定方面（如个性化质量）的指标，研究人员通常依赖多个大型语言模型来进行元评估，这会增加成本。为了减少资源浪费，提出了此方法。

**Method:** 提出了名为PerQ的计算高效的文本个性化质量评估方法。

**Result:** 案例研究结果表明，PerQ在研究中可用于比较大型和小型语言模型的生成能力，证明了该指标的实用性。

**Conclusion:** 新方法PerQ为文本个性化质量提供了有效的评估工具，减少了资源浪费。

**Abstract:** Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大语言模型（LLM）代理由于受限于有限的上下文窗口，需要外部记忆系统来理解长期信息。当前依赖于预定义指令和工具来更新记忆的代理通常表现不佳，尤其是在记忆系统变得更为复杂的情况下。

**Method:** 我们提出了Mem-alpha，这是一个强化学习框架，该框架通过交互和反馈训练代理有效地管理复杂的记忆系统。我们还构建了一个专门的训练数据集，涵盖了多轮交互模式，并附带了全面的评估问题，旨在教授有效的记忆管理。在训练过程中，代理处理序列信息块，学会提取和存储相关的内容，然后更新记忆系统。

**Result:** 实证评估显示Mem-alpha在现有的记忆增强代理基准线上取得了显著的改进。尽管仅训练了最大长度为30k个token的实例，但我们的代理对于超过400k个token的序列展示了出色的一般化能力，这超过了训练长度的13倍，显示了Mem-alpha的强大与鲁棒性。

**Conclusion:** 通过记忆构造和信息反馈的直接优化，Mem-alpha展示出显著的性能提升，尤其是在一般化能力上。这表明Mem-alpha是一个有效的记忆管理系统。

**Abstract:** Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

**Motivation:** 传统的Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)模型中的路由器函数使用Softmax函数将路由器权重投影到概率简单形中，这种选择在没有原则性设计的前提下被广泛认为是标准做法。作者质疑这种使用的必要性，提出了一种新的替代方法KERN，该方法受到Nadaraya-Watson回归的启发。

**Method:** 作者提出了名为KERN（Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization）的新路由方法，这是一种类似前馈神经网络（FFN）的路由函数，作为Softmax的传统路由选择的替代方案。基于前馈神经网络实现的经验和惯例，推荐在KERN路由函数中使用ReLU激活和ℓ₂规范化。

**Result:** 提出的类似FFN的路由函数KERN在MoE和LLM中的全面实验中得到了验证。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，KERN作为一种“零附加成本”的路由方法，能够有效替代传统的Softmax路由，并且是前馈神经网络和MoE模型中Nadaraya-Watson回归的特殊用例。

**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究动机在于探索多种架构在不同复杂度的序列标注任务中的适应能力，并评估它们在多语言环境下的表现。

**Method:** 研究比较了几种替代架构（xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型和对抗学习）在不同语言和不同复杂度的序列标注任务中的表现。

**Result:** 该研究分析了几种替代架构（xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型和对抗学习）在序列标注任务中的性能表现。相比预先训练的Transformer编码器，这些架构虽然在语言建模中表现出潜力，但在多语言环境中和更复杂的结构性任务上的适应性并不理想，无法保持简单的设置中的高性能。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，尽管一些替代架构在简单的语言建模任务中表现良好，但它们并不一定能很好地泛化到多语言环境或是更复杂的结构性序列标注任务中。

**Abstract:** Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 无参考语料的评估标准虽然与人工判断有高度相关性，但它们设计时并未考虑到对抗系统的目的，即为了获得不合理的高分。这种系统的存在降低了自动评估的可靠性。

**Method:** 提出针对SOME、Scribendi、IMPARA和基于LLM的四个无参考语料评估标准的对抗攻击策略。

**Result:** 发现提出的对抗系统在评分上超过了当前最先进的技术。

**Conclusion:** 该研究强调了建立更稳健的评价方法的需求，以对抗那些旨在误导高评分的系统。

**Abstract:** Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free
metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and demonstrate that
our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

**Motivation:** 现有奖励模型在检索增强生成情境中表现不佳，主要是因为缺乏专门的偏好数据集和模型。

**Method:** Structure

**Result:** 使用RAGferee方法，作者创建了一个小规模的偏好数据集，并微调了从7B到24B参数的奖励模型，这些模型在ContextualJudgeBench评估中的性能超越了当前的70B+参数奖励模型，提高了15.5%。

**Conclusion:** RAGferee作为一种数据转换方法，证明了其在生成更适合于RAG上下文的奖励模型的有效性。

**Abstract:** Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

> A method named RE$^2$ is proposed to improve Chinese grammatical error correction using error explanations for contextually relevant example retrieval, improving performance and creating a valuable dataset of grammatical error explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) by retrieving more relevant examples through error explanations, rather than relying on potentially mismatched examples selected by text similarity.

**Method:** RE$^2$, a method that retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors for Chinese grammatical error correction, using error explanations rather than text similarity.

**Result:** Experiments show an improvement in CGEC performance on two datasets, and a new high-quality dataset of grammatical error explanations (GEE) is also created for use in future studies.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method, RE$^2$, effectively enhances the performance of CGEC systems by utilizing grammatical error explanations for example retrieval, offering a valuable approach and dataset for ongoing research in CGEC and grammatical error explanations.

**Abstract:** The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

> 研究探讨了大型语言模型在处理数学和逻辑推理任务时，其使用的链式思考提示生成的理由的准确性，通过系统性实验设计，揭示了提示正确性、呈现方式和复杂性对模型推理过程的影响。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究动机在于探讨大型语言模型使用的链式思考（CoT）提示在解决数学和逻辑推理任务时生成的理由在多大程度上忠实于底层计算，而不是被嵌入提示中的答案捷径所塑造的叙述。研究者们在已有工作基础上，对提示有无提示符号的情况进行了进一步探讨，提出了在可控提示操作下的CoT忠实性系统研究。

**Method:** 该研究覆盖了四个数据集（AIME、GSM-Hard、MATH-500、UniADILR）和两种最先进的模型（GPT-4o和Gemini-2-Flash）。研究提出了包含正确性（正确和错误）、呈现方式（奉承和数据泄露）以及复杂性（原始答案、二元运算表达、四元运算表达）三个维度变化的结构化提示条件集，并评估了任务准确性和提示符号是否在推理中被明确提及。

**Result:** 研究结果揭露了三个关键发现。首先，正确提示显著提升任务准确性，尤其是在更难的任务和逻辑推理方面，而错误提示则显著降低准确性。其次，提示符号的提及情况是极不平衡的，基于方程式的提示经常被提及，而原始提示则常被沉默采纳，这表明更复杂的提示迫使模型在推理过程中明确表述其依赖性。第三，呈现方式同样重要，奉承性的提示促进了明显的提及，而泄露式的提示虽然提高了准确性但促进了隐蔽依赖。研究人员认为，这可能反映出由于人类反馈（RLHF）相关效应，奉承提示利用了模型的悦人一面，而泄露提示则触发了自我审查的一面。

**Conclusion:** 这些结果共同表明，大型语言模型的推理过程受到捷径手段的系统性影响，这在某种程度上掩盖了其忠实性。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

> 本文提出了一种名为RE-Searcher的方法，该方法通过结合目标导向的规划和自我反思，提高了在复杂搜索环境中的搜索准确性和鲁棒性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识密集型问答和推理方面表现出色，然而它们的实际部署受到知识的时间限制、幻想问题以及有限交互模式的约束。增加外部搜索工具虽可缓解这些问题，但也使这些代理面临复杂的搜索环境，其中查询形式的小变体可能引导推理走向无效轨迹并放大错误。作者旨在分析环境复杂性导致的脆弱搜索行为，并提出解决方案。

**Method:** 通过在搜索过程中明确表述具体的搜索目标，并随后反思检索到的证据是否满足该目标，RE-Searcher 实现了在复杂搜索环境中抵抗虚假线索并进行稳健搜索的能力。

**Result:** <tool_call>

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，该方法提高了搜索准确性，并达到了最先进的结果。扰动研究进一步证明了RE-Searcher 对嘈杂或误导性外部信号的坚固性，缓解了搜索过程的脆弱性。这些发现为将LLM驱动的代理集成到更复杂的交互环境和实现更自主的决策提供了实用指导。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

**Motivation:** 当前机器生成文本检测的研究主要集中在英语上，这使得现有的检测器几乎无法应用于非英语语言。针对中欧语言的研究很少，因此该研究填补了这一空白。

**Method:** 进行了多领域、多生成器和多语言的评估，比较不同训练语言组合的最佳性能，并测试了检测方法的对抗鲁棒性。

**Result:** 研究中发现，监督微调检测器在中欧语言中性能最佳，且对混淆最具抵抗力。

**Conclusion:** 该研究为中欧语言的机器生成文本检测提供了首个基准，并发现了监督微调方法在这些语言中的优越性能。

**Abstract:** Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的基于大型语言模型代理系统的大多数方法依赖于手动设计的流程，限制了它们在不同任务中的适应性。本文旨在解决这一问题，提高系统的跨任务泛化能力。

**Method:** DyFlow框架包含两个核心组件：设计师和执行者。设计师将复杂问题分解为一系列以高层次目标定义的子目标，并基于中间输出和反馈动态规划下一步骤。执行者使用动态操作符，根据上下文自适应参数化来执行每个操作，实现灵活且语义基础的推理。

**Result:** DyFlow在包括社交推理、生物医学任务、数学问题解决和代码生成在内的多样化领域中得到系统性评估，结果表明DyFlow显著优于现有基线，并在各种领域中展示出强大的泛化性能。

**Conclusion:** DyFlow通过动态工作流程生成显著提高了代理系统的适应性和效能，特别是在处理复杂的跨领域任务时。框架代码已公开。

**Abstract:** Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决现有基于扩散模型的动作生成网络中的语义不一致和运动伪影问题。

**Method:** 采用时域轻量级MoCLIP模型和频域低频DCT组件的互补锚点，并通过时间调制机制自适应融合。

**Result:** 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上实现了领先性能，FID分数分别为0.035和0.123。

**Conclusion:** LUMA不仅效果提升，而且收敛速度也比基线快1.4倍。

**Abstract:** While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究激发点在于质疑当前视觉语言模型在基本视觉理解能力上是否真的已经达到顶峰，测试模型在密集场景下进行简单视觉任务的能力。

**Method:** 不同于以往的视觉问题回答（VQA）数据集主要关注全局图像理解，VisualOverload数据集包含了2720个问题-答案对，重点在于考察模型在密集场景中执行简单视觉任务的能力。该数据集由公共领域的高分辨率绘画扫描组成，这些绘画包含多个人物、动作和复杂的背景情节。这些问题被手动标注并分为六个任务类别。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，即使在37个模型中表现最佳的模型（o3）在他们最困难的测试集合上也只有19.6%的准确率，而在所有问题上总体准确率为69.5%。

**Conclusion:** VisualOverload揭示了现有视觉模型在详细的场景解析和逻辑推理能力上的不足，提供了重要的资源帮助社区开发更好的模型。

**Abstract:** Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

> 提出了一种学习框架，可在视频中编辑生理信号，同时保持视觉保真度。方法包括3D VAE编码视频， FiLM解码器以及自适应层归一化层。实验证明该方法在保持视频质量的同时，能够高效地调制心率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 面部视频中存在的生物信号引发隐私担忧，因为它们可能泄露敏感的个人信息。同时，在不破坏视频视觉保真度的情况下编辑面部视频中的生理信号也具有实际应用价值。

**Method:** 通过预先训练的3D变分自编码器（3D VAE）将输入视频编码到潜在空间中，并通过冷冻的文本编码器嵌入目标心率提示。使用一组具有自适应层归一化的可训练空间-时间层融合它们，以捕捉远程光体积描记图（rPPG）信号的强时间一致性。在解码器中应用特征线性调制（FiLM），并通过微调输出层来避免重建过程中生理信号的退化，从而实现重建视频中的准确生理调节。

**Result:** 实验证明，该方法在选定的数据集上，在视觉质量上平均PSNR为38.96 dB，SSIM为0.98。同时，使用最先进的rPPG估计器，该方法在心率调制错误上表现出平均10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE的性能。

**Conclusion:** 设计的方法能够有效控制心率编辑，在实际应用中能够匿名化真实视频中的生物信号，或合成具有所需生命体征的逼真视频，展示了该设计的良好实用性。

**Abstract:** Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

**Motivation:** 探讨和解决视觉语言模型在空间推理方面的系统性弱点，以提升其理解物理空间的能力。

**Method:** SpinBench, 一个基于认知的诊断基准，用于评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力。该基准围绕视角转换时场景和物体关系的变化这一核心挑战设计，包括了一系列精细化诊断类别。这些类别涵盖了平移、旋转、物体相对位置和视点变化，并逐步构建，从单个物体的简单任务过渡到最具挑战性的多个物体视角转换任务。

**Result:** 评估了37个最先进的视觉语言模型，包括专有和开源模型，结果揭示了系统性弱点，如强烈的自我中心偏见、较差的旋转理解以及在对称和语法重组下的不一致性。随着规模的增加，性能有所提升并出现了新的能力。人类参与者在任务中的准确率为91.2%，人类的反应时间与VLM的准确率显示出强相关性。

**Conclusion:** SpinBench提供了一些关键见解，揭示了视觉语言模型在空间推理方面的能力差距，有助于进一步提升它们的理解和推理能力。

**Abstract:** We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

> 本文提出MM-STT框架在公共数据集EGMS上实现了比现有方法更优的高分辨率地面沉降预测效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 预测高分辨率地面沉降是一个具有复杂非线性动态特性的关键且具有挑战性的任务。标准架构如ConvLSTM往往无法很好地处理长距离依赖，因此有必要提出革新方法。

**Method:** 此论文提出了名为Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT)的新框架，核心创新点在于其联合时空注意力机制，能够以统一的方式处理所有多模态特征，解决了单一模态数据范式的局限性。

**Result:** 本文提出了一种新的框架MM-STT，通过融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验，解决了传统的单一模态数据范式在预测高分辨率地面沉降方面的局限性。实验结果表明，MM-STT在公共数据集EGMS上的长距离预测RMSE比其他模型降低了近一个数量级。这表明，架构对深度多模态融合的内在能力对于达到变革性性能至关重要。

**Conclusion:** MM-STT证明了它的革新优势，尤其是在解决地面沉降预测时多模态融合能力的重要性，为此类问题的解决方案开辟了新道路。

**Abstract:** Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

> 提出了DepthLM方法，通过稀疏文本监督微调使VLMs在无需复杂修改的情况下实现了对3D问题，尤其是度量深度估计的高精度理解，超过纯视觉模型的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前VLMs如GPT-5难以通过2D输入理解3D，而纯视觉模型在度量深度估计方面表现出超人精度，但需要特定架构和损失函数。因此探索VLMs在不改变架构或损失函数的情况下实现专家级精度的可能性。

**Method:** 通过文本监督微调，利用稀疏标签解锁VLMs的强3D理解能力。解决了像素参考和跨数据集相机歧义，使用视觉提示和固有条件增强。

**Result:** DepthLM使用较小模型使VLMs的准确性超过最先进的VLMs 2倍以上，首次使VLMs与纯视觉模型的性能相当。此外，自然地避免了过度平滑问题。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明VLMs能够通过简单的文本监督微调完成高级3D理解任务。同时，解决了一些技术瓶颈，使VLMs在3D任务上具有更好的性能和适应性。

**Abstract:** Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于海冰特征细微、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战，绘制高精度且具有可靠不确定性的全北极海冰地图是具有挑战性的，因此提出了该方法。

**Method:** 提出了一个基于Bayesian Transformer的新方法，用于北极海冰浓度(SIC)地图绘制和不确定性量化，该方法融合了Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2的数据。其中包括设计了一个全局和局部模块并存的高分辨Transformer模型以提升特征提取效果；设计了基于随机变量参数的Bayesian扩展以捕捉不确定性；通过决策级数据融合解决了数据异质性问题。

**Result:** 在2021年9月的全北极数据集上的测试结果表明，该模型不仅能够生成高分辨率的SIC地图，还能提供相比于其他不确定性量化方法更为健壮的不确定性地图。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，通过该方法可以改善北极地区SIC的地图绘制，同时提高不确定性量化的精确度。

**Abstract:** Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，基于卡尔曼滤波的传感器融合技术能够有效地补偿单独传感器的弱点，从而实现精准而稳健的车辆追踪，为在复杂交通环境下主动安全措施的基础设施使能多传感器系统的部署提供了一条实用途径。

**Abstract:** Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

> 这篇论文提出了一个新的范式，即“先感知后推理”，用于改进多模态语言模型的伪造图像检测性能。通过这个新方法，模型能够更准确地感知和解释伪造图像。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于多模态大规模语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉编码器主要优化语义导向识别而非低级信号感知，直接使用这些模型进行伪造图像检测会导致次优性能。本文旨在解决模型对伪造图像敏感度不足及训练数据分布不均等问题。

**Method:** 我们提出一个新的范式——先感知后推理。在该范式下，多模态大规模语言模型（MLLMs）首先需要接受视觉伪影感知训练，以此强化其对伪造痕迹的视觉感知能力，从而使后续推理基于实际观察。

**Result:** 提出Forensic-Chat，这是一个具有一般性、可解释性且支持多轮对话的伪造图像检测助手。另外，还提出ExplainFake-Bench，一个专门用于评估MLLM可解释性的基准。广泛实验显示了其在泛化能力和可靠解释方面具有优越性。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果显示Forensic-Chat在泛化能力和可靠解释方面具备独特优势，证明了“先感知后推理”范式的有效性。

**Abstract:** Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the issue of real-time phishing attacks during video meetings by malicious actors using deepfake technology, focusing on a behavior deepfakes can't replicate: realistic gaze patterns.

**Method:** This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method by using point-of-gaze tracking, utilizing the subtle nonverbal communication which deepfakes cannot mimic.

**Result:** The model achieved an accuracy of 82% on a novel dataset of their creation.

**Conclusion:** This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking for detecting deepfakes, showing potential to counter real-time phishing attacks by malicious actors via deepfake technology during video calls.

**Abstract:** With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

**Motivation:** The motivation for this research is to enhance object localization for a robotic arm during the Mars Sample Return mission, specifically in scenarios with hardware limitations, to enable reliable and efficient operations in such environments.

**Method:** We propose a novel localization algorithm that uses a custom renderer and a new template matching metric tailored for edge computing environments. This method uses only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs.

**Result:** The evaluations conducted on synthetic datasets, physical testbeds, and in-situ Mars imagery show that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art in compute and memory-constrained localization, demonstrating superior robustness and accuracy.

**Conclusion:** Our method not only outperforms existing approaches in terms of robustness and accuracy but also provides a cost-effective solution for reliable localization on general-purpose hardware, opening new possibilities for future missions and applications.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

**Motivation:** 户外驾驶场景中的指代定位具有挑战性，因为存在大量的场景变化、许多视觉上相似的对象以及动态元素，这些都使得解决自然语言引用变得复杂。

**Method:** LLM-RG 方法结合了现成的视觉-语言模型以进行细粒度属性提取，与大型语言模型一起进行符号推理。该方法处理图像和自由形式的引用表达式，使用LLM提取相关对象类型和属性，检测候选区域，生成丰富的视觉描述，并将这些描述与空间元数据结合起来，输入给LLM 进行链式思考推理，以识别引用对象的边界框。

**Result:** LLM-RG方法在Talk2Car基准上显示了相对于基线方法的显著优势；增加3D空间线索进一步增强了模型的性能。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明，LLM-RG在Talk2Car基准上相对于基于LLM和VLM的基线有显著提升。此外，研究表明增加3D空间线索可以进一步提高定位效果。该研究展示了在零样本情况下VLM和LLM的互补优势，适用于稳健的户外指代定位。

**Abstract:** Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的VLMs行为控制方法存在系统提示容易被用户指令覆盖以及基于激活的引导向量要求侵入性运行时访问模型内部等问题，因此研究能够跨多个VLMs的引导方法是必要的。

**Method:** 本文通过优化视觉输入来实现行为控制，生成的VISOR++图像可模仿多模型的引导向量，从而控制模型行为，无需侵入模型内部。

**Result:** 实验表明，VISOR++图像在开放访问的LLaVA-1.5-7B和IDEFICS2-8B等模型上，以及在多个未见模型上都展示了方向上的行为转变潜力，并且在与MMLU评估任务无关的任务上保持了近100%的性能。

**Conclusion:** VISOR++图像可在无需运行时模型访问的情况下实现VLMs行为控制，且方法具备跨模型的一致性和鲁棒性。

**Abstract:** As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

**Motivation:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

**Abstract:** Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

**Abstract:** Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development
and evaluation of specialized vision-language models capable of advancing
aquatic science.

> A new cross-attention-based aggregation method within the AttentionViG architecture improves feature aggregation and achieves state-of-the-art performance on image recognition and other vision tasks with reasonable efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** There is a need for a versatile feature aggregation method in ViGs that can effectively capture complex relationships between nodes and neighbors without requiring specific architecture adjustments, improving upon conventional graph convolution techniques like Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE.

**Method:** The paper proposes a cross-attention-based aggregation method for Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs), where the query projections are derived from the node and the key projections from its neighbors. This novel cross-attention scheme is incorporated into a new architecture named AttentionViG, which facilitates non-local message passing.

**Result:** AttentionViG demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet-1K image recognition benchmark. It was also evaluated for its transferability to downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K, showing strong performance with comparable computational efficiency to previous vision GNN architectures.

**Conclusion:** The introduction of the cross-attention-based aggregation method in AttentionViG provides a significant improvement in aggregating information between nodes and their neighbors within ViGs, while maintaining computational efficiency and strong performance across various vision tasks.

**Abstract:** Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

> 本文介绍了一个大规模的胸部X光图像数据集MetaChest，并进行少量样本学习的实验，旨在提升病理解分类的准确性。结果显示迁移学习方法优于ProtoNet扩展方法，且高效模型在资源消耗方面表现良好。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于标注数据的有限性，深度学习方法在医学影像分析中的应用受到挑战。该研究旨在利用少量标记样本识别新分类的方法，同时在学习新分类时利用已知的其他分类知识，适用于病理解分类等医学应用。

**Method:** 抽象未详细描述具体方法，但提到使用了标准迁移学习方法和ProtoNet扩展方法来处理数据集。MetaChest数据集包含大规模胸部X光影像，并设计了元集划分专门用于标准少量样本分类及多标签场景的生成算法。

**Result:** 实验证明，在少量样本多标签分类任务中增加一次性处理的类别数和每个类别训练样本数可以提升分类表现。迁移学习方法结果优于ProtoNet扩展方法。更高分辨率的图像提高了准确性但增加了计算量，而高效模型架构可以实现与大型模型类似的性能但资源需求显著减少。

**Conclusion:** 本研究提出了MetaChest数据集，并展示了在少量样本学习中的实验结果，指出了数据规模、模型架构和图像分辨率对模型性能的影响。研究表明，在少量样本学习中，迁移学习方法表现更好，高效模型能有效利用资源。

**Abstract:** The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

> K-Prism框架通过整合三种知识范式，实现了灵活且高效的医学图像分割。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的医学图像分割模型主要基于单一知识源，难以应对临床中需要融合多样知识的需求。

**Method:** K-Prism采用了三种知识范式：语义先验、上下文知识和交互反馈，并通过1D稀疏提示和2D密集提示，结合Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）解码器进行动态路由。

**Result:** 在涵盖多种模态的18个公共数据集上，K-Prism展现了在语义、情境和交互分割设定中的先进性能。

**Conclusion:** K-Prism展示了一种新的方法，通过系统化整合多种知识，可以有效地提升医学图像分割的整体性能。

**Abstract:** Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

*Yijia Weng,Zhicheng Wang,Songyou Peng,Saining Xie,Howard Zhou,Leonidas J. Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

> 本研究提出了一种名为GaussianLens的方法，通过融合多模态信息，实现基于稀疏高分辨率视图的局部高分辨率重建。这种方法可以通过对初始低分辨率3DGS的区域感兴趣部分进行高密度化处理，从而有效捕捉细节，同时避免全分辨率重建的成本和冗余。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的3D高斯点云重建方法在处理局部精细重建时面临挑战。它们要么难以实现高分辨率重建，要么需要大量的密集观测和较长的离线优化时间。而用户往往只需要对某些关键区域进行高分辨率重建。因此，我们提出了一种解决方案，以实现局部高分辨率重建。

**Method:** GaussianLens方法是一个前馈高密度化框架，它融合了初始3DGS与多视角图像的多模态信息。此外，我们还设计了一个像素引导的高密度化机制，可以有效地在大幅提高分辨率的情况下捕捉细节。

**Result:** 实验表明，我们的方法在局部精细重建方面表现出色，可扩展至分辨率高达$1024×1024$的图像。

**Conclusion:** 研究提出的方法证明可以在保持高效性能的同时，灵活应对基于特定区域的高分辨率要求，为未来更精细的场景重建提供了新的方向。

**Abstract:** We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

**Method:** 构建了一个大规模的多模态眼科基准数据集，包含32,633个实例，跨越12种常见眼科疾病和5种成像模式，支持解剖结构识别、疾病筛查、疾病分期和人口统计学预测等任务。提升了数据集规模，扩展了任务覆盖面，并系统地评估了24个最先进的多模态语言模型（MLLMs）。

**Result:** 顶级模型在零样本设置下的疾病筛查准确率达到了约58%，但在疾病分期等复杂任务上的表现仍然不佳。

**Conclusion:** 本研究通过发布数据集、整理管道和排行榜，旨在促进眼科人工智能应用的发展，减轻全球视力威胁性疾病的负担。

**Abstract:** Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有大多数跨视角对象地理定位方法都采用基于锚点的范式，但这种方法受限于预定义锚点，本文旨在消除这种依赖。

**Method:** 本文提出了一个无锚点的跨视角对象地理定位方法，名为AFGeo。AFGeo直接预测每个像素到真实物体框的四个方向偏移，无需预定义的锚点。为了获得更稳健的空间先验，AFGeo整合了高斯位置编码（GPE）来在查询图像中建模点击点。此外，AFGeo还引入了跨视角对象关联模块（CVOAM），将同一对象及其周围环境在不同视角下关联起来，以便在大的跨视角外观差距下实现可靠的定位。

**Result:** 通过采用一个包括GPE和CVOAM的无锚点定位范式，AFGeo在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并且保持了轻量化和计算高效性。

**Conclusion:** AFGeo提供了一个有效的跨视角对象地理定位解决方案，无需预定义的锚点，引入高斯位置编码和跨视角对象关联模块，以增强空间位置的稳健性和可靠性，同时保持轻量化高效性。

**Abstract:** Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Address the issue of degraded performance of cross-modal retrieval models with keys composed of fused image-text modality and the limitation of careful dataset curation for composed sets of image-text triplets.

**Method:** Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal retrieval performance by enforcing contrastive learning across all modalities within a mini-batch using existing image-caption paired datasets.

**Result:** Demonstrates consistent performance improvements on off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models using M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

**Conclusion:** GCL overcomes the limitations of existing multimodal retrieval methods, improving performance and generalization across unseen modality combinations.

**Abstract:** Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

**Motivation:** 现有的遥感图像字幕生成研究主要集中在图像级别上，缺乏对象级别的细粒度解释，无法充分利用遥感图像中的语义和结构信息。Geo-DLC任务旨在解决这一局限性。

**Method:** 提出Geo-DLC任务，即面向遥感图像的细粒度目标级别图像字幕生成。为支持该任务，构建了DE-Dataset，一个含有25个类别和261,806个注释实例的大型数据集，并提出了DE-Benchmark评估套件。引入了DescribeEarth模型，一种为Geo-DLC任务设计的多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）架构。

**Result:** DescribeEarth模型在DE-Benchmark上优于现有的通用MLLM，表现出更高的事实准确性、描述丰富性和语法规则性，特别是在捕获内在对象特征和周围环境属性方面。

**Conclusion:** 研究展示了在遥感图像细粒度描述方面，通过提出Geo-DLC任务和对应的基准测试以及DescribeEarth模型可以实现更大的目标准确性、描述性和语言结构完整性。

**Abstract:** Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

**Motivation:** 自动化缺陷检测模型能够解决工业制造中耗时且劳动密集型的任务，提高制造过程的效率和准确性。

**Method:** 使用包含金属板材图像的数据集来训练YOLO模型以检测板材表面和孔洞中的缺陷，由于金属板材图像的不足，采用了ConSinGAN生成大量数据。评估了四个版本的YOLO模型(YOLOv3, v4, v7, v9)，并与ConSinGAN结合进行数据增强。

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 动机是解决当前AI生成图像（AIGI）检测和源头模型归属所面临的挑战，因生成模型结构的多样性导致现有检测方法容易过度拟合特定伪造特征，而源头归属则通过细粒度特征区分提供了一个更为稳健的替代方案。但合成图像归属由于大规模、分类良好的合成数据集的匮乏而受到限制。

**Method:** 提出了一种新的图像归属范式，称为开放集、少量样本源头识别。该范式旨在仅使用有限的样本就能可靠地识别未知生成器，特别适用于实际应用。为此，引入了OmniDFA框架，该框架不仅能够评估图像的真实性，还能在少量样本的情况下确定图像的合成来源。

**Result:** 实验表明，OmniDFA框架在开放集归属方面表现出色，并在AIGI检测上达到了最先进的泛化性能。

**Conclusion:** 结论是OmniDFA作为一种新的检测和少量样本归属框架，可以有效地用于识别AI生成图像的来源，并且在克服当前方法局限性方面显示出优越性能。

**Abstract:** AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines

> 本文提出了AIMCoT框架，解决了现有多模态链式思考方法在视觉语言推理中的不足，通过主动信息驱动的策略和动态注意力触发机制提升了系统性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 为解决现有方法被动选择策略及注意力图机制的缺陷，提出了AIMCoT框架来改进多模态思考过程中的视觉语言推理能力。

**Method:** AIMCoT包含三个协同组件：上下文增强注意力图生成（CAG）、主动视觉探测（AVP）、动态注意力转换触发器（DAT），这三个部分共同工作以提高框架的性能。

**Result:** 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试中，AIMCoT显著优于现有的最先进方法，展示了其更健壮和有效的多模态推理能力。

**Conclusion:** 通过主动获取信息和动态结构化推理，AIMCoT代表了向更稳固、高效以及类似人类的多模态推理能力迈出的关键一步。

**Abstract:** Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

> 研究揭示了扩散模型中记忆化的中心驱动机制是早期去噪过程中的过估计现象，导致多样性的减少、去噪轨迹的崩溃以及向记忆化图像的快速收敛。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管扩散模型在图像生成上取得了成功，但它们有可能记住训练数据，这引发了严重的隐私和版权问题。此前的研究试图表征、检测和减轻记忆化，但其如何产生、为何产生的问题仍未解决。

**Method:** 通过重新审视扩散和去噪过程并分析潜在空间动力学来探讨'扩散模型如何记忆'这个问题。研究表明，记忆化是由早期去噪过程中的训练样本过估计驱动的，这减少了多样性，导致去噪轨迹崩溃，并加速了向记忆化图像的收敛。具体来说：(i) 内存化不能仅通过过拟合来解释，因为在内存化情况下训练损失更大，这是因为分类器自由指导放大了预测并导致过估计；(ii) 被记忆的提示将训练图像注入噪声预测中，迫使潜在轨迹收敛并引导去噪朝向与之配对的样本；(iii) 中间潜在值的分解揭示了初始随机性是如何被迅速抑制并被记忆内容所取代的，与理论去噪计划的偏差几乎完全对应于内存化严重程度。

**Result:** 研究表明，记忆化是由早期去噪中的训练样本过估计驱动的，这减少了多样性，崩溃了去噪轨迹，并加快了向记忆化图像的收敛。此外，揭示了初始随机性是如何被迅速抑制并被记忆内容所取代的，与理论去噪计划的偏差几乎完全对应于记忆化严重程度。这些结果确定了早期过估计是扩散模型中记忆化的中心潜在机制。

**Conclusion:** 这些结果确定了早期过估计是扩散模型中记忆化的中心潜在机制。

**Abstract:** Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

> ProbMED, a new multimodal pretraining model, uses probabilistic contrastive learning to better handle the many-to-many relationships between medical modalities, showing improved performance across various tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current medical vision-language pretraining models do not account for the many-to-many relationships between medical modalities, which are crucial for medical decision-making.

**Method:** Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED) utilizes probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over embeddings, aligning four distinct medical modalities into a unified probabilistic embedding space.

**Result:** Experiments across 13 medical datasets show that ProbMED outperforms existing methods in cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification.

**Conclusion:** ProbMED effectively integrates multiple medical modalities, demonstrating improved intra- and inter-modality binding for tasks such as prognostication.

**Abstract:** Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

> 提出MISP-DPO，利用多个语义不同的负面图像解决多模态偏好优化中的优化偏差和幻觉问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的方法依赖于过于简化的成对比较，这不足以捕捉多模态偏好中的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉。

**Method:** MISP-DPO方法通过Plackett-Luce模型在多模态DPO中引入多个语义不同的负面图像。该方法在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，并使用稀疏自编码器揭示可解释的语义偏差因素。负面样本的选择基于重建难度、正样本语义偏差以及相互多样性，从而提供更广泛和更有信息量的监督。为了处理多负面比较，该方法采用Plackett-Luce目标，并引入重要性抽样策略以提高训练效率。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，在五个不同的基准测试中，MISP-DPO方法在多模态对齐方面优于先前方法。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，语义感知和多负面采样在基于偏好的学习中是有效的，MISP-DPO优于其他方法。

**Abstract:** Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

> SAGE method advances Visual Place Recognition by integrating spatial-visual context and dynamic sample organization to achieve SOTA performance with state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve VPR by addressing the limitations of existing methods, which mainly focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies, lacking a focus on the dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during training.

**Method:** Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration (SAGE) is proposed to enhance spatial-visual discrimination in VPR. It includes a Soft Probing module that learns residual weights for patch descriptors and a dynamic geo-visual graph construction process that fuses geographic proximity and visual similarity for sample organization.

**Result:** SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight benchmarks, with Recall@1 rates of 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% on SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. It achieves 100% Recall@10 on SPED with only 4096D global descriptors.

**Conclusion:** SAGE, implemented with a frozen DINOv2 backbone, demonstrates superior performance in VPR tasks by significantly enhancing spatial-visual discrimination through adaptive graph exploration and efficient sample organization.

**Abstract:** Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and

> LaTo improves face editing by leveraging landmark tokens, flexible geometry-appearance interaction, and vision-language models for identity-preserving and semantic-consistent editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing face editing models, which struggle with precise attribute control and identity preservation, causing degradation when dealing with significant expression or pose changes.

**Method:** LaTo, a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained, identity-preserving face editing, is introduced. It includes a landmark tokenizer, a location-mapping positional encoding, and a landmark predictor using vision-language models for accurate target landmark prediction based on instructions and source images.

**Result:** Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaTo surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency.

**Conclusion:** The proposed LaTo method, with innovations like landmark tokenization and positional encoding, successfully enhances the precision and identity preservation in face editing, outperforming current models.

**Abstract:** Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

**Motivation:** 鉴于视频对象分割(VOS)在现实世界复杂情况下的难度，包括长期物体消失和再次出现，以及小而不起眼的物体存在，提出了一个针对性更强的方法以提升其在复杂场景下的鲁棒性。

**Method:** 在训练阶段，冻结了SAM2的特征提取器，仅对剩余组件进行微调以保持强大的特征提取能力并提高分割准确性。在推理阶段，采用像素检查策略逐步通过多个模型的互补优势进行预测校正，得到稳健的最终掩码。

**Result:** 该方法在MOSEv1 Challenge中的测试集上实现了86.37%的J&F得分，排名第一。

**Conclusion:** 结果表明该方法在处理复杂现实世界条件下的视频对象分割任务时非常有效。

**Abstract:** Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term

inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in

**Conclusion:** 该方法克服了传统方法在精度和样本多样性之间的权衡，提供了与最先进确定性模型竞争的单一预测结果。

**Abstract:** We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this work is to enhance the precision and consistency of drag-based image editing by incorporating 3D geometry into the process, addressing current limitations with geometric-intensive tasks.

**Method:** The paper introduces GeoDrag, a method that integrates 3D geometric cues with 2D pixel editing, providing a coherent and structure-consistent image manipulation approach.

**Result:** Experimental results indicate that GeoDrag outperforms existing methods in precision, structural consistency, and multi-point editability, achieving reliable and high-fidelity editing under various scenarios.

**Conclusion:** GeoDrag demonstrates significant improvements in geometric manipulation by integrating 3D geometric information with the traditional 2D pixel-based editing approach, thus providing a more robust tool for image editing.

**Abstract:** Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be

*Mingyang Li,Yimeng Fan,Changsong Liu,Tianyu Zhou,Xin Wang,Yanyan Liu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

> This paper introduces IPDRecon, an innovative framework aiming to improve indoor scene reconstruction by reducing reliance on multi-view constraints and leveraging richer spatial data within individual images, demonstrating significant improvements in reconstruction stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this paper is to address the limitations of existing volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods that heavily depend on multi-view images. The reconstruction quality is highly sensitive to the view density and performs poorly in overlapping areas and unobserved regions, calling for methods with reduced dependency on inter-view geometric constraints.

**Method:** The paper proposes IPDRecon, a new image-plane decoding framework that consists of three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These components work together to decode 3D structural information from 2D images through the physical imaging process, with a focus on preserving geometric features and improving view-invariant reconstruction.

**Result:** Experiments on ScanNetV2 show that the proposed IPDRecon framework notably enhances reconstruction quality, maintaining near-identical quality with 40% fewer views. Key performance metrics include a coefficient of variation of 0.24%, a performance retention rate of 99.7%, and a maximum performance drop of just 0.42%

**Conclusion:** The conclusion highlights the effectiveness of the IPDRecon framework in achieving superior reconstruction stability, even when the view count is significantly reduced. The method's robustness in practical applications with limited views is emphasized by the experimental results showing high performance retention and minimal quality degradation.

**Abstract:** Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the existing challenges in aligning garments precisely and preserving the identity and background details in non-try-on areas by improving upon the limitations of latent diffusion models in virtual try-on tasks.

**Method:** The paper proposes ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion framework for virtual try-on that aims to improve the preservation of the non-try-on regions by integrating a residual prior-based initialization and artifact-free measurement-guided sampling.

**Result:** Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0 datasets show that ART-VITON performs better in visual quality and maintainability compared to the existing methods.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that ART-VITON effectively preserves the identity and background, eliminates boundary artifacts, and enhances visual fidelity and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods when tested across various datasets.

**Abstract:** Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

> A novel framework named Text Preference Optimization (TPO) is introduced to enhance the alignment between text prompts and generated images in diffusion-based text-to-image models without the requirement for paired image preference data, demonstrating superior performance in human preference scores and alignment accuracy compared to prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome the scalability limitations associated with high costs and dependency on high-quality human annotations in current text-to-image model training methodologies, driven by the inadequacies of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).

**Method:** Text Preference Optimization (TPO) is introduced to achieve text-to-image (T2I) model alignment without needing paired image preference data. This is accomplished by training the model to prefer matched prompts over mismatched prompts, where mismatched prompts are generated by perturbing original captions using a large language model.

**Result:** Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate that TPO-based methods, TDPO and TKTO, surpass their original counterparts in human preference scores and text-to-image alignment performance.

**Conclusion:** The proposed TPO framework, demonstrated through TDPO and TKTO, offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for improving text-to-image alignment in diffusion models by eliminating the need for paired image preference data and relying instead on perturbed text prompts.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 为了评估并诊断多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在理解幽默方面的能力，研究者提出了一种新的以视觉为中心的视频幽默理解基准v-HUB。好的幽默理解模型在提高人机交互的参与度等方面具有现实潜力。

**Method:** 引入了v-HUB这一新颖的以视觉为中心的视频幽默理解基准，它由精选的极简语言短片组成，这些短片源自经典默剧和在线资源，并反映了仅通过视觉线索即可欣赏幽默的现实情境。每段视频剪辑都伴有丰富的注释，包括字幕、描述和解释，支持字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，从基于文本的评估转变为仅基于视频（无音频）的评估时，所有模型在字幕匹配上的表现都有显著下降。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，加入音频有助于视频幽默理解，突出了声音的信息量，并强调了在复杂的视频理解任务中整合更丰富模态的前景。

**Abstract:** AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

> We propose a new framework, Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO), that addresses training instability in text-to-image models through proportional credit assignment, stabilizing training and improving image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind our research is to solve the training instability and high variance issues of policy gradient methods in text-to-image models, which limit convergence speed and image quality.

**Method:** Our method, Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO), addresses the instability in text-to-image models by enforcing proportional credit assignment, reformulating the training objective to be more stable, and reweighting timesteps in a principled manner.

**Result:** With our method, training is stabilized, convergence is accelerated, and image quality is vastly improved, particularly by mitigating model collapse, a common issue in recursive training.

**Conclusion:** PCPO provides a significant improvement over existing policy gradient baselines, including the state-of-the-art DanceGRPO, showcasing robust performance and enhanced image quality.

**Abstract:** While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管先前的反演方法能够真实地重构源图像，但在遵循目标文本提示方面存在挑战，限制了进行所需编辑的灵活性。

**Method:** 通过分析噪声图的特性以增强编辑性，提出了一种可编辑噪声优化方法，以最小化重建噪声图和编辑后噪声图之间的差异，从而与所需编辑内容对齐。

**Result:** 实验表明ENM Inversion在图像编辑任务中，无论是在内容保真度还是编辑保真度方面，都能超越现有方法。

**Conclusion:** 研究提出了一种名为ENM Inversion的新反演技术，可以在保留内容的同时增强编辑能力，适用于视频编辑，可以实现帧间的时间一致性和内容操纵。

**Abstract:** Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

> EvoQuality, a self-supervised framework, autonomously refines a VLM's image quality assessment capabilities, surpassing some supervised models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the reliance on costly human-annotated data in enhancing VLMs with IQA capabilities, by applying a novel self-supervised approach named EvoQuality.

**Method:** EvoQuality is a novel framework that enables a vision-language model (VLM) to autonomously refine its quality perception through self-supervised learning, using pseudo-labels generated from pairwise majority voting on the VLM's outputs.

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate a significant 31.8% boost in zero-shot performance on PLCC across diverse image quality assessment (IQA) benchmarks, with EvoQuality outperforming state-of-the-art supervised models on 5 out of 7 IQA benchmarks.

**Conclusion:** EvoQuality effectively improves a VLM’s quality perception without relying on human-annotated data, achieving competitive performance with supervised models.

**Abstract:** Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

**Motivation:** 由于心电图（ECG）成本低且易于获取，研究旨在提高ECG预测心脏功能测量的能力，进而作为一种更可访问的替代方法来预测通常由复杂模态如超声心动图（ECHO）获得的关键结果。

**Method:** 研究提出了一种称为EchoingECG的概率学生-教师模型，该模型结合了概率跨模式嵌入（PCME++）框架和ECHO-CLIP（基于ECHO和文本对预训练的视觉-语言模型），以从ECHO中提取知识并提升基于ECG的心脏功能预测。

**Conclusion:** 该方法通过集成概率跨模态嵌入和视觉-语言预训练模型，显著提升了基于ECG的心脏功能预测能力，同时提供了对预测模型中的不确定性的洞察。

**Abstract:** Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is
available: https://github.com/mcintoshML/EchoingECG.
