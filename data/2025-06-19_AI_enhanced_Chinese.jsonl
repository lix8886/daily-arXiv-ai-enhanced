However, existing video\ngeneration datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they\nsuffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,\nand a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we\nintroduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person\nview worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It\nconsists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from\nover 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and\neffective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,\nscene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments\ndemonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an\ninteractive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in\nJapanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world\nexploration, and motivate valuable applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "论文介绍了Sekai，一个用于世界探索的高质量第一人称视角的世界视频数据集，并在此基础上训练了一个交互式视频世界探索模型YUME。", "motivation": "现有视频生成数据集在用于世界探索训练时存在一些局限性，如地点有限、时长短、场景静态及缺乏探索和世界相关的标注。为此，研究人员引入了Sekai数据集，旨在弥补这些不足。", "method": "该研究开发了一种高效的工具箱，用于收集、预处理和标注视频，包括位置、场景、天气、人群密度、字幕和相机轨迹等丰富信息。", "result": "实验表明了数据集的质量，并使用其子集训练了一个交互式视频世界探索模型。", "conclusion": "Sekai将对视频生成和世界探索领域产生积极影响，并推动有价值的应用发展。"}}

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing\nfeatures within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,\nhowever, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or\npoor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to\nAccelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,\nper-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set\nof calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or\nreference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables\nfine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly\nto different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable\napproach for accelerating diffusion inference.
