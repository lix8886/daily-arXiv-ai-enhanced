> 本文提出了一种统一的协同训练框架，可以在单一的监督微调阶段集成多种安全行为模式，并通过简单的系统指令实现灵活切换，这提高了大型语言模型的安全性和可控性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的大型语言模型内容安全方法如监督微调和基于人类反馈的强化学习存在多阶段训练管道并且缺乏细粒度的部署后控制能力，本文为了改进这些局限性，提出了新的解决方案。

**Method:** 提出了一种统一的协同训练框架，该框架能够在单一的SFT阶段集成正向、负向和拒绝三种安全行为模式，并且通过所谓的'魔法令牌'在推理时实现行为的动态切换。

**Result:** 该方法在安全对齐质量上与SFT+DPO方法相当，同时显示了本方法8B模型在安全表现上超过了DeepSeek-R1（671B），并且训练复杂性和部署成本都显著降低。

**Conclusion:** 本文证明了该协同训练策略带来的安全对齐质量提升和模型安全性的增强，提出了一个可扩展、高效、高度可控的大型语言模型内容安全解决方案。

**Abstract:** Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 分享初步排名结果，帮助任务参与者准备他们的系统提交论文。

**Method:** 使用自动评估指标进行系统评估。

**Result:** 该摘要简要描述了WMT25通用机器翻译共享任务的初步排名情况，该排名基于自动评估指标。然而，这种方法可能偏向于使用重排序技术（如质量估计重排序或最小贝叶斯风险解码）的系统。正式的排名将基于更可靠的人员评估。此报告的目的是与任务参与方分享初步结果，以便他们准备系统提交论文。

**Conclusion:** 这只是初步结果，最终排名将由人类评估决定。

**Abstract:** We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

### [3] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

> 提出了一种基于LLM的文化本地化框架，以克服低资源语言中多语言和文化基础数学推理的不足。通过实验展示了提高模型鲁棒性的潜力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于反映准确的本土实体（如人名、机构名称和货币）的社会文化任务数据集匮乏，多语言和文化基础的数学推理在低资源语言中落后于英语。

**Method:** 提出了一种基于大语言模型的文化本地化框架，该框架可以自动从现有来源构建包含本地姓名、组织和货币的数据集。

**Result:** 发现翻译的基准在适当的社会文化背景下掩盖了真正的多语言数学能力。通过广泛的实验，还表明该框架有助于缓解以英语为中心的实体偏差，并在引入多种语言的本土实体时提高鲁棒性。

**Conclusion:** 该框架能够自动构建真正本地化的数学问题数据集，从而提高在不同语言中引入本土实体时的模型鲁棒性。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

### [4] [Improving LLMs for Machine Translation Using Synthetic Preference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14951)
*Dario Vajda,Domen Vreš,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究指出通过DPO方法和程序化筛选数据集，改善大型语言模型在机器翻译上的性能。实验结果显示，在翻译维基百科文章时，优化的模型相较于原始模型提高了大约0.04和0.02的COMET评分，并且能更一致地避免语言和格式错误。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 探讨如何使用相对较少的易于生成的数据资源提高经过通用指令调优的大型语言模型在机器翻译中的性能。本研究以斯洛文尼亚语为例进行说明。

**Method:** 通过直接偏好优化(DPO)训练方法，使用程序化筛选和增强的公共数据子集改进了一个大型语言模型GaMS-9B-Instruct。为了生成DPO训练所需的成对质量排名实例，我们利用两个大型语言模型GaMS-9B-Instruct和EuroLLM-9B-Instruct翻译英文维基百科文章，并结合启发式方法和自动评估指标如COMET对结果翻译进行排序。

**Result:** 实验表明，经过优化的模型在翻译维基百科文章时，分别比两个用于生成数据集的原始模型提高约0.04和0.02的COMET评分，并且能更一致地避免语言和格式错误。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，通过直接偏好优化方法改进的大型语言模型在机器翻译任务上的性能可以得到显著提升，即便使用相对较少的数据资源。

**Abstract:** Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

### [5] [Multilingual Datasets for Custom Input Extraction and Explanation Requests Parsing in Conversational XAI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14982)
*Qianli Wang,Tatiana Anikina,Nils Feldhus,Simon Ostermann,Fedor Splitt,Jiaao Li,Yoana Tsoneva,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

> The paper presents new datasets, MultiCoXQL and Compass, and a parsing approach to enhance the performance of multilingual ConvXAI systems, addressing the issues of limited training data and support for custom inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The primary motivation is to address the challenge of scarce training data for multilingual applications and the limitation in supporting free-form custom inputs in ConvXAI systems.

**Method:** The paper introduces MultiCoXQL, a multilingual dataset, and a parsing approach to improve multilingual parsing performance. It evaluates three LLMs using various parsing strategies on MultiCoXQL. The Compass dataset, tailored for custom input extraction in ConvXAI systems, is also introduced, with evaluations conducted using three LLMs and BERT-type models.

**Result:** Evaluation of LLMs on MultiCoXQL and Compass using various parsing strategies, demonstrating improved performance in multilingual and cross-lingual contexts.

**Conclusion:** The research contributes to advancing ConvXAI in multilingual contexts by providing new datasets and parsing approaches, which could significantly enhance the interpretability and usability of AI models across different languages.

**Abstract:** Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [7] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了LongRecall，这是一种三阶段召回评估框架，旨在提高长文本问题回答中的准确性，减少错误的同时容纳文本的多样性和上下文变化。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的召回指标通常依赖于词汇的重叠，这会导致错误，例如无法处理没有实质性实体和解释性答案的情况。而带有长可理解提示的方法可以捕捉更广泛的语义，但容易产生对齐和幻觉问题，缺乏结构化验证。因此，我们需要一个更精确的评估框架。

**Method:** 我们引入了LongRecall，这是一个通用的三阶段回顾评估框架。该框架首先将答案分解为独立的事实，然后通过词汇和语义过滤逐步缩小潜在匹配项的范围，最后通过结构化的蕴含检查来验证事实的对齐。这种设计减少了假阳性和假阴性，同时适应了多样的表达方式和语境变化。

**Result:** 我们的实验显示，在三个具有挑战性的长文本问答基准测试中，LongRecall相比于强大的词汇和LLM作为评判的方法，在召回准确性的评估上有了显著的改进。

**Conclusion:** LongRecall框架通过其系统化的事实对齐验证方法，为问答任务，特别是在医学和法律等领域，提供了增强的准确性和可靠性，在确保召回的完整性上具有显著的优势。

**Abstract:** LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

### [8] [Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090)
*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种通过结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和组合推理来解决结构化预测问题的方法，通过实验展示了这种结合能获得更加一致和准确的预测结果，并证明了即使在LLMs时代，结构化学习仍然具有重要的价值。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型（LLMs）在不需要针对特定任务进行微调的情况下，对于多种语言任务都有所帮助，但由于其自回归性质，这些模型往往难以解决幻觉问题（hallucinations）和复杂推理问题。

**Method:** 通过结合大型语言模型（LLMs）与组合推理来解决结构化预测中的问题，尝试将大型语言模型的预测能力与推理方法提供的结构一致性相结合。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，通过在提示策略之上添加符号推理，可以获得更加一致和准确的预测结果。此外，使用结构化预测目标进行校准和微调可以提高在具有挑战性的任务上的性能。

**Conclusion:** 即使在LLMs时代，结构化学习仍然具有很高的价值。

**Abstract:** LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi,Sanjeev Satheesh,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro*

Main category: cs.CL

> 提出并构建了高质量数学语料库Nemotron-CC-Math，通过特别设计的稳健科学文本提取管道解决了现有数据集的质量问题，显著提高了预训练语言模型在数学和通用推理任务上的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的专注于数学的数据集，例如基于Common Crawl构建的，存在质量下降的问题，原因是提取算法不够完善，HTML到文本的转换丢失信息，数学结构的可靠性无法保证。因此，本研究旨在解决这些问题，并提升大型语言模型在数学推理能力上的表现。

**Method:** 介绍了一种名为Nemotron-CC-Math的大型高质量数学语料库，该语料库通过从Common Crawl构建，使用了一种新型的领域通用管道，专为稳健的科学文本提取而设计。这种方法可以恢复各种格式的数学表达，包括MathJax、KaTeX、MathML，并通过布局感知渲染和针对LLM的清理阶段来保持方程式和代码块的结构完整性，去除冗余内容，规范化符号，并纠正不一致性。

**Result:** 构建了名为Nemotron-CC-Math-3+ (133B tokens) 和 Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens) 的高质量数学语料库。相较于此前最优质的数学预训练数据集FineMath-4+ ，Nemotron-CC-Math-4+在token数量上增加了5.5倍。使用这些数据集预训练Nemotron-T 8B模型时，相较于强有力的基线模型，分别在MATH 和 MBPP+上提升了4.8到12.6以及4.6到14.3的成绩，并在MMLU和MMLU-Stem上提高了通用领域的表现。

**Conclusion:** 为从嘈杂的网域级数据中可靠地提取科学内容，包括数学内容，提出了首条管道线。该方法在数学、代码以及通用推理任务中取得了可量化改进，建立了开放数学预训练语料库的新标准，并开放了代码和数据集以支持开源工作。

**Abstract:** Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

> 论文主要研究了如何识别和回答含有错误假设的问题，通过事实验证和利用外部证据来减少大型语言模型的幻觉问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 该论文的研究动机是解决大型语言模型在面对含有错误假设的问题时，容易生成误导性答案的问题。

**Method:** 该研究方法是首先将问题简化为事实验证，接着提出利用外部证据来减少大型语言模型的幻觉问题。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，通过整合检索到的证据可以提高回答准确性，并且生成和验证原子假设能够进一步提升性能，从而提供一个更具解释性的答案，明确指出错误的假设。

**Conclusion:** 结论是，整合外部证据和生成验证原子假设可以提高LTM在处理含有错误假设问题上的准确性和解释能力。

**Abstract:** People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

### [11] [ContextualLVLM-Agent: A Holistic Framework for Multi-Turn Visually-Grounded Dialogue and Complex Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15164)
*Seungmin Han,Haeun Kwon,Ji-jun Park,Taeyang Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

> 该论文提出了MMDR-Bench和CoLVLM Agent框架，以解决现有大视觉语言模型在复杂多模态对话任务上的不足。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 为了应对现有模型在处理复杂、多轮次、视觉引导任务时的挑战，比如深度推理、持续上下文理解、实体追踪和多步骤指令遵循等问题，本文提出了新的数据集和框架。

**Method:** 本文提出了一个名为MMDR-Bench的新型数据集，其中包含了300个精心设计的复杂多轮次对话场景，并评估了六个核心维度。同时，引入了CoLVLM Agent框架，通过迭代的“记忆-感知-规划-执行”循环，增强了现有大视觉语言模型的高级推理和指令遵循能力。

**Result:** 广泛实验表明，CoLVLM Agent在MMDR-Bench上持续表现出色，得到平均4.03的人类评价得分，超过GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro等其他先进模型。

**Conclusion:** 该框架在推理深度、指令遵循和错误抑制方面表现出色，其模块化设计和迭代方法在这类复杂多模态交互中显示出有效性。

**Abstract:** Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [12] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

> 提出SemToken方法，通过语义感知技术优化分词，减少冗余，提升计算效率，在长文本处理中表现出色，实现了数量级上的分词减少和速度提升。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的分词方法如字节配对编码（BPE）或WordPiece忽略了文本的潜在语义结构，导致语义冗余片段的过度分词以及上下文连贯性的不足，特别是在长时间跨度的场景中。

**Method:** SemToken, 一个语义感知的分词框架，首先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，并进行局部语义聚类以合并语义等价的词。然后，它根据语义密度分配异构的词粒度，在内容丰富的区域进行更细粒度的分词，在重复或低熵片段进行更粗的压缩。

**Result:** 在长时间跨度的语料库，如WikiText-103和LongBench上，SemToken实现了最多2.4倍的分词数量减少和1.9倍的速度提升，没有任何或可以忽略的困惑度和下游准确性的下降。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，语义结构为大型语言模型中的分词和计算优化提供了一个有前景的新方向。

**Abstract:** Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

*Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Jie Zhu,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一个针对金融领域的过程奖励模型（Fin-PRM），用于评估金融任务中的中间推理步骤。实验表明，Fin-PRM在选定高质量推理路径、提供密集过程级奖励和测试时表现优于通用和领域基线模型，展示了在金融推理基准上的显著性能提升。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的过程奖励模型主要基于通用或STEM领域进行训练，对于金融等专业领域的应用有限，尤其是当推理更为结构化、符号化以及对事实和法规准确性更为敏感时。本论文旨在解决现有PRM在金融领域中的不足。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一个专门针对金融领域的过程奖励模型（Fin-PRM），它能够对金融任务中的中间推理步骤进行评估。Fin-PRM 结合了步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，并在离线和在线奖励学习设置中分别支持三个关键应用：选择高质量的推理轨迹进行蒸馏式监督微调、提供密集的过程级奖励进行强化学习，以及在测试时指导奖励知情的最佳N项推理。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，在金融推理基准CFLUE和FinQA上，Fin-PRM在轨迹选择质量上持续优于通用和领域基线模型。通过Fin-PRM训练的下游模型分别在监督学习、强化学习和测试时性能上实现了12.9%、5.2%和5.1%的提升。

**Conclusion:** Fin-PRM在金融任务中的表现优于通用和专业基线，表明了领域专项奖励模型在将语言模型与高级金融推理对齐中的重要价值。项目资源可在指定GitHub页面获取。

**Abstract:** Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our

Main category: cs.CL

> The paper introduces SPARK, a method designed to improve long-context inference in large language models by imposing unstructured sparsity on the KV cache at the channel level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the KV cache bottleneck in long-context inference for large language models (LLMs) where existing methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis).

**Method:** SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation.

**Result:** SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. It reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods for sequences of equal length, while preserving or improving model accuracy.

**Conclusion:** SPARK demonstrates its robustness and effectiveness by maintaining model performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, making it a promising approach for reducing the KV cache bottleneck.

**Abstract:** Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at

*Bolei He,Xinran He,Run Shao,Shanfu Shu,Xianwei Xue,Mingquan Cheng,Haifeng Li,Zhenhua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种新的框架Selct2Know (S2K)，该框架采用内部-外部知识自我选择策略和选择性监督微调来增强领域专业知识。实验结果显示该框架在医疗、法律和金融领域的问答基准上优于现有方法，在成本更低的情况下匹配领域前训练的LLMs。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型在通用问答中表现出色，但在特定领域的场景中往往表现不佳。检索增强生成 (RAG) 引入外部知识但会因检索噪音而产生幻觉和延迟。持续预训练虽然能内化领域知识但成本高昂且缺乏跨域灵活性。这些问题主要是由于领域知识的长尾分布导致的，使得部分有用的内部知识被未充分利用。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为Selct2Know (S2K) 的成本效益框架，该框架通过内部-外部知识自我选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识。还介绍了一个结构化推理数据生成流水线，并集成GRPO以增强推理能力。

**Result:** 在医疗、法律和金融问答基准测试中，S2K 一致优于现有方法并且在成本显著降低的情况下与领域前训练的大型语言模型匹配。

**Conclusion:** Selct2Know (S2K) 是一种成本效益的框架，通过内部-外部知识自我选择策略和选择性监督微调来有效解决大型语言模型在特定领域应用中的挑战。实验结果证明了其优越性和经济效益。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

> SEER方法提出了一种自动扩展和逐步改进的方式，用于大语言模型（LLMs）在面对复杂多步工具调用时的表现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的工具调用方法依赖手动设计特定任务的演示或从精挑细选的库中检索，这要求大量的专家努力，且随着工具多样性和任务复杂性增加，提示工程变得越来越复杂和低效。为了解决这个问题，提出SEER方法。

**Method:** SEER (Stepwise Experience Recall) 方法，通过细粒度、逐步检索不断更新的经验池来工作。该方法通过增量方式用过去的成功轨迹扩充经验池，从而实现池的持续扩张和模型性能的逐步提升。

**Result:** SEER在ToolQA基准测试上容易的问题提高了6.1%，困难的问题提高了4.7%。在包含两个实际领域的$\tau$-bench测试中，使用Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen2.5-72B模型时，SEER展现了显著的准确性提升，分别为7.44%和23.38%。

**Conclusion:** SEER通过自我引导的方式解决了多步工具使用中的挑战，建立了自动扩展和性能提升的能力，证明了其提升模型在实际领域中工具调用性能的能力。

**Abstract:** Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

> 本研究探讨了在评估生成任务时选择性地使用检查表的有效性，并发现这种做法在成对比较任务中表现良好，但在直接打分任务中效果不那么一致。另外，即使一些与人类评分相关性低的检查表项目也反映了人类制定的标准，指出需要更明确地定义评估标准。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 出于对基于大型语言模型的生成任务自动评估存在的模糊标准的挑战性，本研究探索自动检查表生成的潜力及其有效性的探索性研究。

**Method:** 我们研究了检查表是否应用于所有问题还是应选择性使用，使用六种方法生成检查表，并评估它们在八种模型规模中的有效性，同时确定与人类评估相关的检查表项。

**Result:** 实验结果显示选择性地使用检查表在成对设置中提高了评估表现，但直接评分任务中的效果不显著。此外，研究表明即便是评分与人类标准相关性较低的检查表项目也反映了人为标准，这显示出人类评估中可能存在的一致性问题。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果强调了应更明确地定义用于指导人类和自动评估的标准。

**Abstract:** Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了VocabTailor，一种新型的动态词汇选择框架，可以大幅减少小语言模型的内存使用，且不损害任务性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管小型语言模型在计算上具有优势，但内存限制仍然是边缘设备部署的瓶颈。当前的静态词汇修剪方法虽然能减少内存占用，却导致信息丢失和灵活性缺失。

**Method:** 基于词汇局部性和小语言模型相关组件计算特性的不对称性原则，本文提出了VocabTailor，一个新颖的解耦动态词汇选择框架。它通过卸载嵌入实现内存约束的缓解，并对语言模型头实行混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，实现了按需加载词汇组件。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，VocabTailor可以将词汇相关的组件内存使用量减少高达99%，并且任务性能几乎没有或完全没有下降，明显优于现有的静态词汇修剪方法。

**Conclusion:** VocabTailor为解决小语言模型在边缘设备部署中的内存瓶颈提供了有效的方法，通过灵活的词汇选择策略实现资源的有效利用。

**Abstract:** Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 在资源较少的语言如泰语上的大语言模型的应用效果研究还不充分。现有的基准测试经常依赖翻译，忽略掉文化及领域特定的细微差别。为了解决这个问题，需要有更文化及领域背景布景的指令数据集。

**Method:** 本文提出了WangchanThaiInstruct，这是一个用泰语编写的数据集，用于评估和指令调整，涵盖了四个专业领域和七种任务类型。数据集的创建经过了一个包括标注者、领域专家以及AI研究人员在内的多阶段质量控制过程。

**Result:** 通过此数据集进行的零样本评估展示了文化与专业相关的任务上的性能差距，而通过原生监督来调整指令的实验显示，使用该数据集微调的模型在专业内和跨领域基准测试中都表现更佳。

**Conclusion:** 研究发现强调了在资源较少、语言文化多样的环境下，为了提高大语言模型的表现，需要有文化及领域背景的指令数据集。

**Abstract:** Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

> 研究开发了EMNLP框架，用于评估LLMs在教师角色中的道德和规范行为。实验揭示了LLMs与人类教师在性格和道德推理上的异同，并指出这些模型在应对情感复杂情境时的挑战和安全问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管大型语言模型能够模拟专业角色，但在这些情境中的全面心理和伦理评价仍然不足。这项研究旨在弥补这一空白，特别是在教育领域，确保教育AI的伦理和心理对齐。

**Method:** 介绍了一个名为EMNLP的框架，该框架对大型语言模型（LLMs）在扮演教师角色时进行道德和规范评定。EMNLP不仅扩展了现有的量表，还构建了88个教师特定的道德困境，用于与真正教师的对比评估。此外，通过一种针对性的软提示注入集来评估LLMs在教师模拟角色中的合规性和脆弱性。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，扮演教师角色的LLMs展现了比真正教师更为理想化和两极分化的性格特质，在抽象道德推理方面表现出色，但在情感复杂的情境中表现出不足。同时，具有更强推理能力的模型对有害提示注入更为脆弱，揭示了能力与安全之间的悖论。

**Conclusion:** 该论文提供了第一个评估教师角色LLMs伦理和心理对齐的基准。研究结果强调了在教育AI领域中对LLMs进行伦理和心理评估的重要性。尽管模型温度和其他超参数在大多数情况下影响有限，但在某些风险行为中展现出影响。

**Abstract:** Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的检索增强生成（RAG）方法在外部知识与模型内置知识产生冲突时表现不佳。我们的目标是解决这种上下文-记忆冲突问题。

**Method:** 我们提出了CARE方法，它包括一个上下文评估器和一个基础的LLM。上下文评估器从原始上下文token中编码紧凑的记忆token嵌入。通过基于grounded/adversarial的soft prompting，上下文评估器被训练来识别不可靠的上下文并捕捉一个指导信号，引导推理朝向更可靠的知识来源。

**Result:** 大量的实验表明，CARE能有效缓解上下文-记忆冲突，在问答和事实核查基准任务上的性能平均提高了5.0%。

**Conclusion:** CARE方法在提高检索增强生成系统的可信度和适应性方面展示出了前景。

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于时间常识在文本中很少被明示，导致即使是高级的大型语言模型在生成需要时间常识推理的文本时也会遇到困难。本研究旨在通过自动挖掘时间常识，以创建更健壮的语言模型。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动挖掘事件的时间常识的流水线，并使用这些常识构建了一个名为TComQA的数据集，该数据集基于SAMSum和RealNews语料库。

**Result:** TComQA数据集通过众包验证，其时间常识提取的精度超过了80%。使用TComQA训练的模型在时间问答任务上优于仅经过现有数据集微调的LLM模型。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，通过挖掘文本中的时间常识，可以有效提高语言模型在时间相关的任务中的性能，从而为构建更强的语言理解机制提供了新的途径。

**Abstract:** Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 许多语音处理任务需要纯净的音素表示，不受上下文影响，这促使我们开发了CUPE。

**Method:** CUPE - 一种轻量级模型，能够在仅120毫秒的语音片段中捕获关键音素特征。该模型独立地处理短的、固定宽度的时间窗口，在少于当前方法的参数数量情况下，通过学习所有语言共有的基本声学模式来实现跨语言性能的竞争力。

**Result:** 在广泛的评估中，包括通过监督学习和自监督学习在多种语言上的训练，以及在UCLA音素语料库上的零样本测试，CUPE展示了强大的跨语言泛化能力，揭示了通过建模音素长度窗口内的基本声学模式实现有效的通用语音处理的可能性。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果显示，通过建模音素长度窗口内的基本声学模式，有效的通用语音处理是可能实现的。

**Abstract:** Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有评价KG完成模型的指标难以进行跨数据集和指标的综合比较，导致选择最优模型困难。

**Method:** 提出了一种基于距离平均解的KG评估方法（EDAS），该方法将模型在多个数据集和多种评价标准下的性能综合成一个归一化的分数（$M_i \in [0,1]$）。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，EDAS方法在FB15k-237和WN18RR等基准数据集上验证有效，能够提供一致、鲁棒且通用的评价框架。

**Conclusion:** EDAS作为一种全局视角的评价方法，支持更明智的模型选择，促进了跨数据集评价的公平性。

**Abstract:** Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

**Abstract:** In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

> 提出了MultiTrust-X，一个全面评估和分析多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）可信赖性的基准，揭示了现有模型中显著的脆弱性和现有缓解策略的局限性，并引入了RESA方法来改进安全性和性能的平衡。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在可信赖性方面的局限性，特别是与多模态相关的新风险，以及现有评价和缓解方法存在的问题。

**Method:** 定义了一个三维框架，涵盖五种可信赖性方面（真实性、鲁棒性、安全性、公平性和隐私性）、两种新型风险（多模态风险和跨模态影响），并提出了从数据、模型架构、训练、推理算法等多个角度的缓解策略。MultiTrust-X包括32个任务和28个数据集。

**Result:** 揭示了当前模型在可信赖性方面的显著漏洞，包括信任度与一般能力之间的差距，以及基础LLMs在多模态训练和推理过程中潜在风险的放大。同时也发现现有缓解策略存在局限性，引入了RESA方法改进模型在安全性和性能之间的平衡。

**Conclusion:** 研究揭示了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的局限性和现有缓解策略的缺陷，并通过引入RESA方法提供了改进方向和实际见解。

**Abstract:** The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### [28] [Confidence-Modulated Speculative Decoding for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15371)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

> 论文提出了一种基于置信度调整的推测解码方法，提升了资源利用率和输出保真度，同时提高了生成质量和速度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的推测解码方法依赖于静态长度的草稿生成和刚性的验证标准，限制了它们在面对不同模型不确定性输入复杂度时的适应性。

**Method:** 该论文提出了一种基于信噪比调整的推测解码信息论框架。通过利用生成器输出分布的熵和基于边界的不确定性度量，该方法能够动态调整每个迭代中的推测生成标记数量。此外，使用相同的置信信号调节验证过程，使已生成的标记接受更加灵活，同时保持生成质量。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，在机器翻译和摘要生成任务中，相比标准推测解码，所提出的方法显著提升了计算速度，同时保持或提高了BLEU和ROUGE评分。

**Conclusion:** 该方法提供了一个适用于大语言模型在不同不确定性条件下的高效且鲁棒的解码方式。

**Abstract:** Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究发现扩大语言模型的词汇量可以减少复杂度并提高性能，主要通过优化高频词的表现来实现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 我们研究了语言模型词汇扩容的影响，以及这种扩容背后的实际效益来源。

**Method:** 我们进行了一项控制实验，将语言模型的词汇量从24K增加到196K，同时保持数据、计算和优化策略不变。

**Result:** 实验显示，随着词汇量的增加，文本的复杂度减少，主要通过减少高频词的不确定性来降低交叉熵损失。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果揭示了语言模型词汇量增加的益处，并强调了模型与分词器协同设计的重要性，简化了预训练阶段的损失动态机制。

**Abstract:** Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

**Abstract:** The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

> 该论文引入MCR-BENCH评估LALMs处理冲突的音频-文本信息的能力，发现这些模型存在文本偏向问题，并探讨了可能的缓解策略。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型音频语言模型虽然增强了音频感知能力，但它们在处理音频和文本模态之间冲突信息方面的表现仍未得到充分探讨。此研究旨在解决这一问题。

**Method:** 该论文介绍了MCR-BENCH，这是一个专门用于评估大型音频语言模型（LALM）在面对不一致的音视频对时，如何处理和优先考虑信息的基准测试。

**Result:** 研究揭示了一些令人担忧的现象，即LALMs存在显著的文本偏向，这导致在音频为主的任务上的表现下降，并对实际应用的可靠性提出了质疑。此外，研究探讨了文本偏向的影响因素，并探索了通过监督微调进行缓解的策略。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现强调了在训练过程中实现更好的模态平衡，以及提高处理冲突的多模态输入时的鲁棒性的必要性。

**Abstract:** Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Main category: cs.CL

> 提出一个完全开放的端到端框架LLaSO，解决大型语音语言模型开发中的问题，并通过实验验证了该框架的有效性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决LSLM领域中模型权重与训练数据及配置透明公布不足的问题，减少研究系统比较和重现的阻碍。

**Method:** 通过引入LLaSO框架解决了大型语音语言模型（LSLM）开发中存在的问题，包括架构的分散性和透明度不足。LLaSO提供了一个完全开放的端到端框架，包括三个关键资源：语音文本对齐语料库LLaSO-Align（1200万个实例），多任务指令调优数据集LLaSO-Instruct（1350万个实例），以及可复现评估基准LLaSO-Eval。

**Result:** 构建并公开了38亿参数的参考模型LLaSO-Base，仅用公共数据训练，取得0.72的规范化分数，建立了一个强大且可复现的基线，超过了类似的模型。表明模型训练覆盖范围的增加可以提高性能，但在未见过的任务，特别是在纯音频场景下，表现仍存在显著差距。

**Conclusion:** LLaSO框架通过提供数据、基准和模型的完整堆栈，建立了开放标准，统一了研究努力，并加速了社区驱动的LSLM进展。

**Abstract:** The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

**Conclusion:** 这项研究为隐私保护的语言模型研究提供了宝贵见解，并指明了未来的研究方向。

**Abstract:** Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights

**Motivation:** 由于不同的文化背景下存在大量没有等值词的语言词汇，导致在翻译过程中容易产生误解。因此，需要专业的翻译方法来消除这种误解。

**Method:** 通过基于图书馆的研究方法，分析了从源语言到目标语言翻译非等值词汇的方法，展示了25个翻译实例。

**Result:** 该研究旨在介绍从源语言到目标语言专业翻译非等值词汇的方法，已完成基于图书馆的研究。研究中涉及了从达语和乌兹别克语到英语和俄语的25个非等值词汇的翻译，并提供了不同的翻译方式和规则。

**Conclusion:** 研究展示了从达语和乌兹别克语到英语和俄语翻译非等值词汇的方法，并提供了多种翻译规则，但仍有更多词汇等待翻译。

**Abstract:** These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 为了提高程序化任务导向对话（TOD）代理的有效性，特别是其对话状态跟踪的准确性，研究提出了PyTOD。

**Method:** PyTOD采用了一种简单的受限解码方法，使用语言模型而非语法规则来遵循API架构，以生成用于跟踪对话状态的可执行代码，并利用策略和执行反馈进行高效的错误纠正。

**Result:** 实验显示，PyTOD在SGD基准测试中达到了当前最佳的状态跟踪表现，并且在准确性以及用户目标的稳健估计方面超过了强基线系统。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，执行感知的状态跟踪技术，如采用PyTOD，能够显著提高对话代理在对话过程中准确性和用户目标估计的稳健性。

**Abstract:** Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

> 本文提出RadReason，一个用于自动评估放射科报告的框架，提供细粒度、可解释的评分，并表现出超越原有指标的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的方法要么产生粗略的总体评分，要么依赖于不透明的黑盒模型，这限制了它们在现实世界临床工作流程中的实用性。因此，本文引入了一种新的框架，旨在为放射科报告提供细粒度的、基于临床的可解释评分。

**Method:** 本文介绍了RadReason，一个用于评估放射科报告的新框架。该框架基于Group Relative Policy Optimization，并引入了两个关键创新：1) 子分动态加权，根据实时F1统计自适应地优先处理临床困难的错误类型；2) 多数引导优势缩放，根据子分一致性调整基于提示难度的策略梯度更新。这些组件共同使模型优化更稳定，并与临床专家判断保持一致。

**Result:** 实验表明，RadReason不仅超越了所有以往的离线指标，而且在与基于GPT-4的评估相媲美的同时，保持了可解释性、成本效率和临床适用性。

**Conclusion:** RadReason框架在评估放射科报告时表现出色，能够在没有牺牲可解释性和成本效率的情况下实现与先进模型的性能匹敌，非常适合临床部署。代码将在论文发表后公开。

**Abstract:** Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有研究指出，成功的个性化策略能将收入提高多达40%，凸显了开发智能、数据驱动的优惠生成方法的战略重要性。为此，研究者提出了SLM4Offer模型。

**Method:** SLM4Offer采用对比学习方法对预训练的编码解码语言模型（如Google的T5-Small 60M）进行微调，使用InfoNCE损失在共享嵌入空间中对齐客户画像与相关优惠。关键创新在于通过对比损失引入的自适应学习行为，这种行为在训练过程中重塑潜在空间，提高模型的泛化能力。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，与监督微调基线相比，优惠接受率提高了17%，突显了对比目标在推进个性化营销中的有效性。

**Conclusion:** 对比学习方法对于个性化优惠生成带来了显著改善，能够更有效地提升客户对优惠的接受程度，从而助力营销策略的优化。

**Abstract:** Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

> 研究质疑大型语言模型能否有效捕捉用户的个体差异性行为偏好。通过提出HeTLM方法，研究证明对于个性化行为，小型LM能更优地表示“浏览语言”，并能更有效地捕捉用户差异性，同时保持高平均表现和低性能波动。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文探讨了大型语言模型在处理具有高度主观性行为和偏好的用户时的效果。面对不同用户的多样化和个性化活动，如网站或应用程序的浏览历史，作者旨在研究小型语言模型相较于大型语言模型是否能更有效地理解用户的行为风格，以及单个语言模型能否适配多样化的用户偏好。

**Method:** 该研究通过引入HeTLM（异质性感知语言模型训练），一种针对主观行为的训练方法，采用聚类方式对不同用户群体进行训练，以适应他们各自的行为和偏好差异。研究对比了小型LM和大型LM的表现，并测试了单个LM在适应多样化用户行为和偏好方面的能力以及在用户层面的一致性表现。

**Result:** 研究发现，使用页面级分词器训练的小型LM在表现上优于大型的预训练或微调LM；而具有异质性聚类特定参数集的HeTLM在参数数量相同的情况下，表现优于单一LM；且该方法能够提高生成的一致性，意味着更好的用户层面的一致性表现。

**Conclusion:** 研究结论表明，针对不同用户群体的行为特点，采用异质性感知方法训练模型能够产生更佳的性能，不仅平均表现更高，同时还能降低性能的波动，从而更好地满足不同用户需求。

**Abstract:** A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

**Motivation:** 调查如果用更贴近模型训练过程中的例子难度指标代替传统的基于人类中心的难度指标，课程学习是否能变得更有竞争力。

**Method:** 通过使用训练数据影响力作为排序标准，将训练样本按照模型训练过程中观察到的例子难度进行排序，取代传统的基于人类中心的难度指标，来进行课程学习。

**Result:** 基于我们课程的模型在基准测试中比随机排序训练的模型高出超过10个百分点。

**Conclusion:** 课程学习对于语言模型预训练是有益的，只要采用更以模型为中心的难度概念。

**Abstract:** Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于现有的社会身份检测数据集主要以英语为中心、仅适用于单一标签，并且关注的是粗略的身份类别，因此本研究旨在构建一个多标签希伯来语语料库，以便研究以色列的复杂社会身份。

**Method:** 通过分析以色列政客在Facebook上的帖子（2018年12月至2021年4月）来创建HebID数据集，此数据集包含了5,536个句子，并对12种复杂的社会身份进行了手动注释。作者用多标签分类器和大规模语言模型进行了验证实验，来发现哪种模型最适合此数据集。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，经过希伯来语调优的大规模语言模型提供了最好的结果（宏F1评分为0.74）。应用分类器后，作者对身份表达的流行性、时间趋势、聚类模式以及与性别相关的差异进行了评估，并对外交演说和社交媒体帖子进行了对比。

**Conclusion:** HebID提供了研究希伯来语社会身份的一个全面基础，并可以作为研究其他非英语政治背景下类似问题的参考模型。

**Abstract:** Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

**Abstract:** We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

**Motivation:** 本研究旨在通过大规模计算研究展示PDD（对政治实体的规范有效性的符号攻击）的可行性和价值。

**Method:** 本文介绍了一个两阶段分类流水线，结合了微调的编码器模型和解码器LLMs，用于政治去合法化话语（PDD）的检测和分类。

**Result:** 最佳模型DictaLM 2.0 在二元PDD检测中达到了0.74的F1值，在去合法化特征分类中达到了0.67的macro-F1值。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明自动化PDD分析有助于理解民主话语，PDD在过去三个 decade 中大幅增加，在社交媒体上比在议会辩论中更为常见，男性政治家比女性政治家使用的更多，右翼群体在选举和重大政治事件期间表现出更强的倾向。

**Abstract:** We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

**Conclusion:** 此研究的主要贡献包括首个完全自动化基准测试管道和一个全面的安全基准。

**Abstract:** The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

> 本文提出了SDGO，一个强化学习框架，用来对齐大型语言模型的生成能力和判别能力，从而改善模型的安全性，同时保持在一般基准测试中的有用性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型在各种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但仍然容易受到导致生成有害内容的破解攻击。我们发现关键的安全不一致性在于，LLMs能够更有效地识别有害请求作为判别器，但难以防御这些请求作为生成器。这一发现促使我们探索对齐模型的内在判别和生成能力。

**Method:** 我们提出了SDGO（Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization），这是一种强化学习框架，利用模型自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自我改进来提高生成的安全性。这种方法在训练阶段不需要任何额外的标注数据或外部模型。

**Result:** 广泛的实验表明，与基于提示和基于训练的基线方法相比，SDGO显著提高了模型的安全性，同时保持了在一般基准测试上的有用性。

**Conclusion:** 通过使大型语言模型的判别能力和生成能力对齐，SDGO在对抗分布外(jailbreaking攻击)时表现出鲁棒的性能，并实现这两项能力之间的紧密耦合，仅需少量判别样本即可进一步提高生成能力。我们的代码和数据集可在https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO获取。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

**Motivation:** 虽然大型语言模型提供了自动化学术综述生成的潜力，但由于缺乏标准化的基准和评估协议，这一领域的进步受到了阻碍。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了SurGE。

**Method:** 我们引入了SurGE（Survey Generation Evaluation），这是一个用于评估计算机科学领域科学调查生成的新基准。SurGE包括一系列测试实例，每个实例包含一个主题描述，一个专家撰写的调查报告及其所有引用的参考文献，以及一个包含超过一百万篇论文的大型学术语料库作为检索池。此外，我们还提出了一种自动评估框架，该框架从四个方面衡量生成的调查报告：信息覆盖率、参考准确度、结构组织和内容质量。

**Result:** 对多种基于LLM的方法的评估结果显示，即使是最先进的自我反思框架，调查报告生成仍然极具挑战性。这些发现突出了任务的复杂性和继续研究的必要性。

**Conclusion:** 我们开源了所有的代码、数据和模型，方便研究人员进一步探索和改进科学调查文章的自动生成技术。

**Abstract:** Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

**Motivation:** 先前工作尝试通过修改导致PB的架构来减轻PB，但PB仍然显著。为了有效解决PB，提出了Pos2Distill框架。

**Method:** Pos2Distill框架，从有利位置向不利位置转移知识以减少性能差距。

**Result:** 在长上下文检索和推理任务中，提高了所有上下文位置的性能和均匀性，并且两种专门的系统在各自的任务上表现出色，同时具有强的跨任务泛化能力。

**Conclusion:** Pos2Distill框架通过利用位置引起的差异来对抗PB，有效减少了性能差距并增强了上下文处理能力。

**Abstract:** Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

**Conclusion:** 该论文倡导开发强大的孟加拉语词干提取器，并继续在这方面进行研究，以提高语言分析和处理能力。

**Abstract:** Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

**Motivation:** 现有的数据集在规模和设计上有限，难以系统地研究电子商务平台上的图像是否总能提升产品理解能力。因此，研究者引入了EcomMMMU数据集来解决这一问题。

**Method:** SUMEI方法通过预测每个图像的效用，有策略地利用了多个图像来改进下游任务的表现。

**Result:** 全面的实验展示了SUMEI的有效性和鲁棒性，显示其在利用图像方面优于多模态大规模语言模型(MLLMs)。

**Conclusion:** 研究指出，在电子商务任务中，多模态大规模语言模型(MLLMs)无法总是有效地利用丰富的视觉内容，SUMEI方法提供了一种解决方案。

**Abstract:** E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through

**Motivation:** 目的是解决医疗大语言模型在准确诊断方面受到的知识盲点和幻觉效应的阻碍，现有方法结合检索和工具辅助方法在利用外部知识和反馈推理可追溯性方面效果有限。通过End-to-end训练框架，使用代理的方法可以更好地利用外部知识和提高反馈推理的可追溯性。

**Conclusion:** 通过对奖励设计和检索语料库组件的消融研究以及病例研究和解释性分析，证明了该方法的独特性和有效性，有助于提供关于其性能改进的深入见解，并支持临床医生进行更可靠和精确的初步诊断。

**Abstract:** Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the limitations of LLMs in tasks requiring precise computations and to study the generalization and impact of TIR on enhancing the reasoning behavior and efficiency compared to models without it.

**Method:** Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) is utilized to improve LLMs' reasoning ability through the incorporation of external tools across various domains. The evaluation is conducted using a novel benchmark, ReasonZoo, and new metrics: Performance-Aware Cost (PAC) and AUC-PCC.

**Result:** The empirical evaluation using ReasonZoo and the proposed metrics indicates that TIR-enabled models outperform their non-TIR counterparts in reasoning tasks with improved efficiency, as measured by PAC and AUC-PCC metrics.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that TIR improves the reasoning ability and efficiency of LLMs in both mathematical and non-mathematical tasks, suggesting its broad applicability and potential for advancing reasoning in complex tasks.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,

below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world

### [55] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

> A new training objective for facial landmark detection is proposed, outperforming traditional methods using Structured Prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To challenge the prevailing use of Soft-argmax in heatmap regression and to improve the efficiency and performance in facial landmark detection.

**Method:** Content describes an alternative to Soft-argmax for facial landmark detection using a structured prediction framework, which enhances the speed and accuracy in training deep nets.

**Result:** The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks WFLW, COFW, and 300W, with faster training times.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that their proposed structured prediction framework is a viable and superior alternative to Soft-argmax for achieving high-performance facial landmark detection.

**Abstract:** Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available

**Motivation:** To enhance image classification by leveraging the ability of graph-based methods to model relational data, addressing limitations of conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

**Method:** Integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with Voronoi diagrams. Represents images as graphs with pixels/regions as vertices, and uses corresponding Delaunay triangulations to optimize graph representation.

**Result:** Significant improvements in preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmarks, performs particularly well in complex scenes and fine-grained categories.

**Conclusion:** Combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams enhances image classification and offers new possibilities for graph-based learning in computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

**Abstract:** The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This

> YOPO, a new method for single-stage RGB-based category-level pose estimation outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To develop a simpler and solely RGB-based solution for category-level pose estimation, avoiding the need for multi-stage cascades or additional data like CAD models or pseudo-depth.

**Method:** Unified approach using single-stage, query-based framework named YOPO for 2D detection and 9-DoF pose estimation. Uses a transformer detector with a pose head, translation module, and Hungarian matching cost.

**Result:** Sets new state-of-the-art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6% IoU50 and 54.1% under the 10°10cm metric.

**Conclusion:** YOPO demonstrates that combining object detection with 9-DoF pose estimation is feasible and effective using only RGB images, setting a new standard for RGB-only pose estimation.

**Abstract:** Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的防伪系统通常针对物理展示攻击和数字伪造分别使用不同的模型，这种做法增加了系统的复杂性和推理延迟，并且容易遭受组合攻击。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种名为Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework的统一训练方法，该方法利用真实图像与攻击图像的自动配对，学习模态无关的活动线索。

**Result:** 该方法在第6届Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge基准测试中实现了2.10%的平均分类误差率，优于先前的解决方案。框架的计算成本低（4.46 GFLOPs）且训练时间少于一小时。

**Conclusion:** 本文提出的方法不仅提高了防伪系统的效能，而且简化了系统结构，减少了计算资源需求，适用于现实世界中的部署。

**Abstract:** Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

> TAIGen is introduced as a training-free, black-box method for generating high-quality adversarial images using fewer steps from diffusion models, outperforming existing methods in both effectiveness and speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the inefficiency and low-quality image issues of adversarial attacks generated by current generative models.

**Method:** Structure

**Result:** TAIGen has demonstrated high success rates against various target models with less computational resources and maintains a PSNR above 30 dB.

**Conclusion:** TAIGen represents a significant advancement in the field of adversarial attack methods, offering a more efficient and effective solution with minimal visual degradation.

**Abstract:** Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

> RUN++ 提出了一种新型的可逆展开网络，结合生成性优化方法，解决了CVP任务中的问题，提升了前景-背景分割的准确性和效率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的CVP方法通常依赖可逆策略来降低不确定性，但这些方法主要局限于掩码域，RGB域的潜力未被充分挖掘。为了弥补这一不足，提出RUN++方法。

**Method:** RUN++ 提出了一种可逆展开网络，结合生成性优化方法，通过将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题并将其展开成多阶段深度网络来解决。该网络包含三个模块：CORE模块用于在掩码域中识别核心对象区域；CARE模块用于提高前景-背景分割；FINE模块引入了基于噪声增强的迭代细化，使用伯努利扩散模型优化不确定区域。

**Result:** RUN++ 方法通过多模块协同工作，显著减少了误报和漏报，提高了CVP系统的鲁棒性，并在实际降质情况下仍能保持良好的效果。

**Conclusion:** RUN++ 不仅在复杂的视觉感知任务上表现出色，还为构建更稳健的CVP系统开辟了新的途径，引入了双层优化框架的概念。

**Abstract:** Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Livestock methane emissions represent 32% of human-caused methane production,
making automated monitoring critical for climate mitigation strategies. We
introduce GasTwinFormer, a hybrid vision transformer for real-time methane

while maintaining exceptional efficiency with only 3.348M parameters, 3.428G
FLOPs, and 114.9 FPS inference speed. Additionally, our method achieves perfect
dietary classification accuracy (100%), demonstrating the effectiveness of
leveraging diet-emission correlations. Extensive ablation studies validate each

**Conclusion:** 曲率意识模型能够显著提高模型遵循复杂指示的准确性，并保持图像的高质量。代码已公开。

**Abstract:** Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at

It introduces novel loss functions and a lightweight variant HiRQA-S for real-time applications, showing state-of-the-art performance and scalability across benchmarks. This paper proposes HiRQA, a novel NR-IQA method that enhances generalization and performance by being self-supervised and using only input images for quality assessment, validating it on a variety of real-world image degradations and benefiting from a fast variant for real-time use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The main motivation is to address the dataset biases and the challenge of generalization in no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA), which often rely on subjective labels or pristine references, thereby limiting their applicability.

**Method:** HiRQA is a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that uses hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through ranking and contrastive learning. It introduces a higher-order ranking loss and an embedding distance loss for quality predictions, as well as a contrastive alignment loss based on structured textual prompts.

**Result:** HiRQA predicts quality scores accurately using only the input image without reliance on pristine references or auxiliary modalities. It effectively generalizes to real-world degradations, demonstrated through evaluations on various distortions including lens flare, haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions, and shows its effectiveness in real-time deployment with HiRQA-S.

**Conclusion:** HiRQA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, strong generalization to various real-world image degradations, and scalability, particularly through its lightweight variant HiRQA-S with fast inference time. The framework overcomes previous limitations by being self-supervised, opinion-unaware, and requiring only the input image for quality predictions. Extensive experiments validate its capabilities across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

**Motivation:** 多视图3D重建应用在紧急响应等情况下需要快速构建情况意识，而边缘计算环境的动态性和操作困难可能导致空间时间相关的中断，影响相机操作和重建质量。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种基于投资组合理论的边缘资源配置策略，以确保在可能的系统中断情况下进行可靠的多视图3D重建。该方法通过遗传算法快速解决优化问题。

**Result:** 实验表明，所提出的相机选择策略在空间时间中断下能够保证可靠的3D重建，优于传统的基准策略。

**Conclusion:** 基于投资组合理论的边缘资源配置方法可以保证可靠的3D重建质量，即使在相机易受空间时间相关中断影响的情况下也能保持。

**Abstract:** Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

**Conclusion:** 实验证明XDR-LVLM提供强大的可解释性见解，能够弥合自动化诊断和临床需求之间的差距，有助于提高临床医生诊断DR的效率和准确性。

**Abstract:** Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

**Result:** 相比現有方法，MeSS在幾何對齊和生成質量方面表現更優。

**Conclusion:** 經合成的場景可以通過重新照明和風格轉換技術渲染為不同的風格。

**Abstract:** Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

> 本文介绍了一个名为SurgWound的首个公开外科伤口数据集，并提出了一套三阶段学习框架WoundQwen，用于外科伤口诊断，包含视觉问答和报告生成任务，以评估模型性能，旨在提供个性化伤口护理，及时干预，改善患者预后。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 面对外科伤口护理在预防手术部位感染（SSI）方面的挑战，本文旨在填补公开外科伤口筛查工具的空白，并通过多阶段深度学习框架提高模型性能。

**Method:** 文章提出了一个三阶段学习框架WoundQwen，包括五个独立的MLLMs来预测伤口特性，两个MLLMs用于诊断结果，以及一个整合前两阶段结果生成全面报告的MLLM。

**Result:** SurgWound数据集由3名专业外科医生标注，包含697张外科伤口图像，涵盖八种细粒度临床属性。WoundQwen框架可以全面评估模型在视觉问答和报告生成上的性能。

**Conclusion:** WoundQwen框架能够详细分析外科伤口特性，并基于手术图像为患者提供后续指导，为个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者预后铺平道路。

**Abstract:** Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

**Motivation:** 大多数现有数据集和自动化方法仅提供了二值（语义）掩码，限制了下游分析的精度。经典后处理技术（如分水岭、形态学操作和骨架化）在分离肾组织中的语义掩码到实例时效果受限，因为肾组织形态多样且结构复杂。

**Method:** DyMorph-B2I, 一种动态、形态学引导的二进制到实例分割流水线，整合了分水岭、骨架化和形态学操作，并具有自适应几何优化和自定义超参数调优功能。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，DyMorph-B2I在分离粘连和异构结构方面比单一经典方法和简单的组合方法表现更优，这有助于提高肾病理工作流程中的实例分离和形态测量分析的准确性。

**Conclusion:** DyMorph-B2I通过系统参数优化，能够稳健地分离二值掩码中的粘连和异构结构，从而在肾病理功能单元的形态量化中实现了更高的精确度。

**Abstract:** Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

**Motivation:** 旨在通过依赖于更加具有挑战性但更具成本效益和易于部署的行車记录器视频输入，来预测事故并实现及时警告，从而改善道路安全。

**Method:** 通过结合更好的时空特征并通过递归网络进行聚合，来改进基于行車记录器视频预测事故的图神经网络方法。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，STAGNet模型在使用行車记录器视频预测事故时表现优异，具有更高的准确性和实用性，为道路安全提供了成本效益高的解决方案。

**Abstract:** Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

> 本文提出了一种新的3D原生生成模型TriMM，它通过协作多模态编码整合多种模态数据来生成更高质量的3D模型，该模型在多个知名数据集上取得了与大规模数据集训练模型相当的性能，即使使用较少的训练数据。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 目前大多数3D原生生成架构局限于单模态或仅限于3D结构，仅考虑某一模态的优势而忽视了多模态数据的互补优势。该研究旨在充分发挥多模态数据在3D建模中的潜力，提出了一种可以从多种基本模态学习的模型。

**Method:** TriMM 是一种基于多模态数据（如RGB、RGBD和点云）的3D原生生成模型。它首先通过协作多模态编码整合了各个模态的特性，同时保持各自的表示优势，并引入了辅助的2D和3D监督来提高多模态编码的鲁棒性和性能，最后基于嵌入的多模态编码采用了三平面潜在扩散模型来生成高质量的3D资产，提高纹理和几何细节。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，TriMM能够通过有效利用多模态数据，在多个知名数据集上展现出与大规模数据集训练模型相当的竞争力，且利用较少的训练数据也能取得良好效果。

**Conclusion:** TriMM作为一种新的3D原生生成模型，通过整合不同的多模态数据成功生成了高质量的3D资产，验证了多模态数据在3D生成中的可行性。

**Abstract:** 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

**Conclusion:** 

**Abstract:** Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

**Conclusion:** 文章介绍了一种创新的双重高度无人机协作视觉与语言导航框架AeroDuo，旨在利用高低无人机的互补优势，在复杂环境中实现稳定高效的导航能力。

**Abstract:** Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

*Wenju Xu*

> This paper introduces a mechanism called skipped-step sampling that allows diffusion models to skip multiple denoising steps during generation, leading to faster sampling without loss of quality, thereby addressing the efficiency issue of these models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this paper is to address the sequential generation limitation of diffusion models, which require a long sequence of steps. The authors aim to achieve a more efficient generation process without resorting to non-Markovian methods, such as DDIM.

**Method:** The paper introduces a technique called skipped-step sampling, which bypasses multiple intermediate denoising steps during the generation process of diffusion models, contrasting with the traditional step-by-step refinement method. This technique is derived from the same training objective as standard diffusion models.

**Result:** The research demonstrates that skipped-step sampling, which is a Markovian method, can effectively reduce the number of sampling steps needed for high-quality generation. When combined with DDIM, it shows further enhancement in generation methods.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that skipping intermediate denoising steps is an intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models, enabling faster sampling without compromising the quality. This discovery opens up possibilities for more efficient diffusion-based model applications.

**Abstract:** Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of traditional image codecs which lack adaptability and require manual mode selection, thereby being unfriendly for non-professional users.

**Method:** Comp-X employs a multi-functional coding framework, interactive coding agent with augmented in-context learning, and an expert-annotated IIC-bench benchmark for evaluation.

**Result:** Experimental results show that Comp-X can efficiently understand coding requests and interact textually, while providing competitive compression performance.

**Conclusion:** Comp-X represents a significant advancement in image compressing techniques by integrating AI and interactive coding, potentially advancing AGI applications in image processing.

**Abstract:** We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

**Conclusion:** Ano-NAViLa effectively addresses the challenges in pathology anomaly detection, achieving high accuracy and robustness, and offering enhanced interpretability through image-text associations.

**Abstract:** Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue

built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa

**Motivation:** 现有方法中的先检测后推理范式导致了受限有效的监督，这影响了车道拓扑推理的表现。因此，作者提出了可以提供数量丰富且几何多样的车道拓扑监督的新策略。

**Method:** 作者提出RATopo方法，引入冗余分配策略来丰富车道拓扑推理的监督信息。通过重新排列Transformer解码器中的交叉注意力和自注意力层，允许在抑制之前保留冗余车道预测。同时，实例化具有独立参数的多平行交叉注意力块，进一步增强检测车道的多样性。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，RATopo策略在OpenLane-V2数据集上显著提高了车道与车道以及车道与交通元素之间的拓扑性能。

**Conclusion:** RATopo是一种模型不可知论的方法，可以无缝集成到现有的拓扑推理框架中，并改善车道之间的拓扑推理性能。

**Abstract:** Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

**Motivation:** 鉴于传统专利图像的局限性使其难以在专利分析任务中提供准确和一致的结果，研究者受到了CLIP模型的启发，以期通过视觉语言模型解锁设计专利分析的潜力，提升专利分析任务的可靠性和精度。

**Method:** 在设计专利分析领域，传统任务如专利分类和专利图像检索主要依赖于图像数据。然而，专利图像通常由体现发明抽象和结构元素的草图组成，往往无法传达完整的视觉背景和语义信息，这会导致在检索先前技术时出现歧义。为了应对这些挑战，本研究利用CLIP（Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training）模型开发了一个统一框架DesignCLIP，用于大规模美国设计专利的应用。DesignCLIP框架通过生成详细的专利图像描述和多视角图像学习来实现类别感知分类和对比学习，以解决专利数据的独特特征。研究通过多项下游任务（包括专利分类和专利检索）验证了DesignCLIP框架的有效性。此外，研究还探讨了多模态专利检索，以从多个角度激发设计创意和创新。

**Abstract:** In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

> The study introduces BasketLiDAR, a multimodal dataset, and a multimodal MOT framework that leverages LiDAR and camera data to provide accurate 3D tracking in real-time, overcoming challenges faced by traditional multi-camera setups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind the paper is to improve real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports which is crucial for tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and spectating experiences. The challenge lies in handling rapid and complex movements with frequent occlusions in a confined space, making traditional multi-camera systems inadequate.

**Method:** The paper introduces BasketLiDAR, a first-of-its-kind multimodal dataset combining LiDAR point clouds and synchronized multi-view camera footage. A novel MOT framework is proposed which includes a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR data and a multimodal pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data to improve tracking accuracy and reduce computational costs.

**Result:** Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves real-time operation and superior tracking performance even under conditions of frequent occlusions, something conventional camera-only approaches struggle with.

**Conclusion:** This research demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of using multimodal datasets, specifically LiDAR and camera footage, for improved real-time 3D trajectory tracking in sports. The proposed framework can be applied to enhance tactical analysis and spectating experiences in professional basketball and potentially other sports.

**Abstract:** Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于现有方法通常依赖于大量的训练和计算资源，而基础模型如SAM尽管具有强大的泛化能力，但在处理隐蔽物体检测任务时仍面临挑战。

**Method:** 该论文提出了一种名为RAG-SEG的无需训练的方法，该方法将隐蔽物体检测任务分为两个阶段：检索增强生成（RAG）用于生成粗略掩码作为提示，然后使用基于SAM的分割（SEG）进行细化。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，在基准隐蔽物体检测数据集上，RAG-SEG方法的性能与或优于最先进的方法，所有实验均在个人笔记本上进行，展示了该方法的计算效率和实用性。

**Conclusion:** RAG-SEG通过构建紧凑的检索数据库实现快速有效的特征检索，并在推理过程中利用检索到的特征生成伪标签来指导精确的掩码生成。此方法无需传统训练且计算需求低，展现了其实用性和高效性。

**Abstract:** Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

**Motivation:** 针对文本到视频扩散模型可能产生的隐私、版权和安全问题，提出一种无需训练的框架，以防止这些模型生成有害或误导性内容。

**Method:** Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA)和Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG)两种方法用于擦除视频中的不需要的内容。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，VideoEraser在四个任务上表现优于先前方法，特别是在减少四个任务中的不需要内容上，平均比基线方法减少46%。

**Conclusion:** VideoEraser可以有效降低文本到视频扩散模型在生成过程中产生不需要内容的概率。

**Abstract:** The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

**Motivation:** 大多数现有研究集中在提高性能上，而很少关注理解其内部机制。该论文旨在通过一个系统的实证研究来填补这一空白。

**Method:** 采用注意机制剔除作为主要分析工具，设计了三种变体：视频时间剔除、视频空间剔除和语言到视频剔除，并在不同数量的层上应用这三种剔除方法，分析VIDEO-LLM的内部机制。

**Result:** 研究揭示了三个关键发现：全局设置表明视频信息的提取主要发生在早期层，形成明显的两阶段过程；细粒度设置表明某些中间层在视频问答中起到关键作用，而大多数其他层贡献微小；两种设置下观察到，时空建模更多依赖于语言引导的检索，而不是视频标记之间的帧内和帧间自注意力机制。

**Conclusion:** 展示了这些见解可以用于减少VIDEO-LLM中的注意力计算，这是首个系统地揭示VIDEO-LLM内部如何处理和理解视频内容的工作，为未来的可解释性和效率提供了新的视角。

**Abstract:** Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

> 研究介绍了一种新的 3DGS 压缩方法 ICGS-Quantizer，提升了压缩效率和适应性，适用于大规模场景归档和变化场景更新。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) 的压缩方法虽已被提出用于存储受限设备的部署，但仍存在两大限制：仅能将中等规模场景压缩到兆字节范围，不适合大规模场景或大规模场景集合；缺乏适应归档后场景变化的机制。因此，提出 ICGS-Quantizer 以改进压缩效率并适应场景变化。

**Method:** Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) 是一种提升压缩效率并适应归档后场景变化的方法。ICGS-Quantizer 通过共同利用高斯之间的相关性和属性相关性来提高量化效率，并使用在所有训练场景之间共享的字典，在已知和未知场景中应用，从而消除了为每个场景单独生成字典的开销。这使得 3DGS 的存储需求减少到千字节范围，同时保持视觉保真度。为了能够适应归档后场景的变化，ICGS-Quantizer 在解码时将场景解码依赖于解码时间捕获的图像。编码、量化和解码过程联合训练，以确保代码（场景的量化表示）对条件解码有效。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，ICGS-Quantizer 在压缩效率和适应场景变化的能力方面始终优于最先进的方法。

**Conclusion:** 研究展示了 Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) 在 3D 场景压缩和 3D 场景更新上的优越性能，解决了现存方法在存储空间和适应性上的限制。代码、模型和数据将在 GitHub 上公开。

**Abstract:** 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods in driving scenarios, which lack robustness in novel view rendering and accurate geometric representation due to overlooking background optimization and relying solely on fitting each training view.

**Method:** DriveSplat, a high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. It uses a region-wise voxel initialization scheme and deformable neural Gaussians, supervised by depth and normal priors.

**Result:** The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios as evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets.

**Conclusion:** DriveSplat provides significant improvements in 3D scene reconstruction for driving scenarios by addressing motion blur and enhancing geometric accuracy.

**Abstract:** In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to enhance the abstract reasoning abilities of machine intelligence by systematically analyzing and addressing the fundamental bottleneck in deep learning models' abstract reasoning capabilities, as highlighted by the challenges in solving Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems.

**Method:** The paper proposes three improvement methods to address the limitations of the DIO model, which failed to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning logic due to issues with the lower bound tightness and the inability of mutual information to capture causal relationships.

**Result:** The DIO model was improved through a series of methods, though the paper does not provide concrete results of these improvements, focusing instead on the methodological framework.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion points out the inherent difficulties in using variational lower bounds of mutual information for modeling causal reasoning in RPM and highlights the proposed methodologies for improvement as a step toward enhancing the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning models.

**Abstract:** Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this paper is to address the limitations of current video summarization techniques, such as difficulty capturing global temporal dependencies and issues with noise and coherence during feature fusion, especially as short video content becomes more prevalent.

**Method:** Our proposed Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network employs a keyframe extractor based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) and a Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner to improve video summarization. It also includes a Variational Inference Reconstruction Module using ELBO and posterior distribution regularization to handle noise and uncertainty during feature fusion.

**Result:** Experimental results show that SpiVG outperforms existing methods across various datasets like SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS.

**Conclusion:** The SpiVG method proposes a new approach to video summarization that resolves the shortcomings of current methods by improving temporal and semantic coherence, and reducing noise through advanced feature fusion techniques.

**Abstract:** With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes

**Motivation:** 尽管MAE作为预训练技术非常有效，但在应用于新数据集时需要大量的超参数调整，包括掩码比例、patch大小以及编码器/解码器层数。该论文旨在研究MAE超参数与下游任务性能之间的联系。

**Method:** 该论文通过解析地推导线性MAE学习到的特征，探讨MAE如何学习输入图像中的空间相关性。研究显示，掩码比例和patch大小可以用于选择捕获短程和长程空间相关性的特征。此外，论文还将这一分析扩展到非线性MAE，以表明MAE表示能够适应数据集中的空间相关性，而不仅仅是二阶统计量。

**Result:** 论文解析性地推导线性MAE学到的特征，并展示了掩码比例和patch大小可以用于选择短程和长程空间相关性的特征。进一步表明，MAE表示能够超越二阶统计量适应数据集中的空间相关性。

**Conclusion:** 该研究为实践中如何选择MAE超参数提供了洞见，并表明MAE的表示能够适应数据集中的空间相关性，这远远超出了二阶统计量。

**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind the BIRD method lies in addressing the shortcomings of the existing sliding-window-based multi-frame approaches. These methods do not optimize the entire video clip and ignore the global temporal information, leading to inefficient computation and less effective detection.

**Method:** The paper introduces BIRD, which employs a bidirectional temporal information propagation strategy in a recursive fashion for moving infrared small target detection. It features both a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module and a Global Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module to integrate local and global temporal information.

**Result:** Extensive experiments confirm that BIRD not only outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection performance but also maintains a fast inference speed, making it an effective and efficient solution for moving infrared target detection.

**Conclusion:** The BIRD method, with its innovative bidirectional temporal propagation strategy and the integration of both local and global spatio-temporal information, has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the performance of moving infrared small target detection while also improving the speed of inference.

**Abstract:** Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

**Abstract:** Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to solve the challenges of semantic frame-level alignment and complex dependencies in Vid2VidMR by proposing a novel transformer-based model, MATR.

**Method:** MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer) is introduced to tackle the Vid2VidMR task. It conditions target video representations on query video features through dual-stage sequence alignment and guides foreground/background classification and boundary prediction for precise moment localization.

**Result:** MATR achieves notable performance improvements (13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU over state-of-the-art on ActivityNet-VRL; 14.7% gain in R@1 and 14.4% in mIoU on SportsMoments).

**Conclusion:** The model is effective for moment localization tasks in video to video retrieval, and its self-supervised pre-training technique contributes to its performance improvements.

**Abstract:** Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

*Zongqi He,Hanmin Li,Kin-Chung Chan,Yushen Zuo,Hao Xie,Zhe Xiao,Jun Xiao,Kin-Man Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

> This paper presents a new SfM-free 3DGS-based method for 3D scene reconstruction from sparse inputs, offering superior performance in PSNR and visual quality compared to existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method requires dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which restricts its application in real-world scenarios with sparse-view inputs.

**Method:** SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs 3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. It includes a dense stereo module for initial camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction, a coherent view interpolation module for additional supervision signals, and multi-scale Laplacian and adaptive spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization for enhancing the quality of geometrical structures and rendered content.

**Result:** The experiments showcase remarkable improvements in PSNR under extremely sparse-view conditions, with a 2.75dB increase using only 2 training views. The synthesized images show minimal distortion and preserve high-frequency details.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches especially under extreme sparsity conditions, leading to better visual quality in synthesized images.

**Abstract:** 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

**Motivation:** 解决现有轻量级模型在性能、计算效率和全局上下文感知能力之间的权衡问题，以及信道冗余问题。

**Method:** LGMSNet采用异构层内核提取局部高频信息，并通过稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支捕获低频全局信息，同时减少信道冗余。

**Result:** 实验表明，LGMSNet在六个公开数据集上超越了现有的最先进方法，尤其在四个未见过的数据集上表现出色。

**Conclusion:** LGMSNet在资源受限的医疗成像环境中展示了其卓越的零样本泛化性能和实际部署潜力。

**Abstract:** Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

**Motivation:** 该工作的动机在于利用多个视角的RGB图改进对人体着装三维模型重建的方法，尤其是提升几何重建和身体姿态估计的准确性。

**Method:** MExECON方法基于ECON单视角人体重建方法，通过引入Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO)算法，扩展了其能力以利用多个视角进行更为准确的三维人体姿态和几何重建。JMBO算法在所有输入视角上联合拟合一个SMPL-X人体模型，以保证多视角的一致性。然后通过法线贴图的集成，加入更多几何细节。MExECON从多个视角集成法线贴图，以便准确捕捉精细的表面细节，如衣服的褶皱和发型。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，MExECON在多个视角下的重建效果始终优于单视角基准，并且性能也与现代的少量样本三维重建方法相当。

**Conclusion:** MExECON证明了通过扩展ECON的方法实现多视角重建，能在不需重新训练网络的情况下提高三维重建的精确度和细节捕捉能力。

**Abstract:** This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

**Method:** 提出了一种名为AdaSFFuse的多模态图像融合框架，其中包括自适应近似小波变换（AdaWAT）和空间-频率曼巴块两个关键点。AdaWAT能够分离不同场景下的多模态图像的高低频成分，而空间-频率曼巴块则促进空间和频率域的跨模态融合，并通过学习映射动态调整以确保多种模态中的稳健融合。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明，AdaSFFuse在多种多模态图像融合任务中表现出色，展现了性能和效率的良好平衡。该框架的代码将在GitHub上公开。

**Abstract:** Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

**Motivation:** 驾驶日志记录的视图合成是模拟自动驾驶车辆驾驶场景的关键任务，但目前存在的方法在几何一致性和渲染方面表现不佳。

**Method:** ExtraGS框架结合了几何和生成先验，使用基于混合高斯符号距离函数的Road Surface Gaussian（RSG）表示和远场高斯（FFG）处理远处物体，同时开发了基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架。

**Result:** 实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实感和几何一致性，同时保留了原始轨迹的高保真度。

**Conclusion:** 该研究提出了一种新的外推视图合成方法ExtraGS，改善了生成视图的真实感和几何一致性。

**Abstract:** Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the limitations of existing methods in handling multi-object interactions and complex motions in sketch animation, such as temporal inconsistency and poor generalization.

**Method:** Our method, GroupSketch, consists of two stages: Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. The first stage divides the input sketch into semantic groups and generates key frames. The second stage uses a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN) that refines the animation by predicting group-specific displacements and includes a Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE) module to improve temporal consistency.

**Result:** Experiments show that GroupSketch significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches.

**Conclusion:** The approach not only enhances the quality of sketch animations but also broadens their practical applications.

**Abstract:** We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,

**Motivation:** 解决高分辨率遥感图像中提取细小道路的挑战，这些道路由于宽度有限、拓扑结构复杂以及频繁遮挡而难以识别。

**Method:** D3FNet采用编码-解码结构，包括DADE模块、DDFM机制和多尺度膨胀策略来增强细小道路特征，抑制背景噪音，并平衡空间精度与语义上下文。

**Result:** D3FNet在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试上的实验结果表明其在提取细小道路方面的优势。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，D3FNet在高难度道路区域的IoU和召回率方面优于现有方法，特别是在提取细小遮挡低对比度道路段方面。

**Abstract:** Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

**Motivation:** To address the limitations in scalability and real-time deployment of existing test-time adaptation methods and to explicitly model class-conditional feature distributions for reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions.

**Method:** ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. It models class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix, and introduces lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank.

**Result:** ADAPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks under various distribution shifts, with superior scalability and robustness compared to existing methods.

**Conclusion:** ADAPT overcomes scalability and robustness issues in TTA by providing a scalable, real-time, training-free framework that can effectively adapt to unseen distributions without the need for iterative optimization or source data.

**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

**Motivation:** 神经网络的频谱偏差问题，即容易偏向低频分量而难以捕捉高频细节（如锐边和细纹），而现有的解决方法主要集中于架构修改或专用激活函数，本研究提出了一个正交方向，直接引导训练过程。

**Method:** 提出了一种两阶段训练策略，第一阶段使用邻域感知软掩模自适应地给局部变化强烈的像素分配更高的权重，以早期关注细节。然后过渡到全图训练。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，本方法能够稳定提升重建质量，并与现有的INR方法互补。

**Conclusion:** 作为首个尝试在图像INR中对像素进行频谱感知重要性赋值的工作，本研究为解决频谱偏差问题提供了新思路。

**Abstract:** Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

**Conclusion:** 进行了形式化的全局最优证明，并通过具有局部最小值接近全局最小值的对抗实例，提供了全局最优性的证据。

**Abstract:** Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

**Abstract:** Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape

> 本研究提出了Grounded VideoDiT，通过引入三种核心创新，如扩散时间潜变量编码器、基于对象的表示形式和混合时间令牌方案，以实现更好的视频理解和时间推理。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 虽然最近的视频大语言模型在整体推理方面取得了显著进步，但它们在时间感知方面仍然是粗略的。时间戳仅被隐式编码，帧级特征在捕捉连续性方面较弱，语言视觉对齐容易偏离兴趣实体。因此，此研究旨在通过设计新模型来克服这些限制。

**Method:** 通过三种关键创新来设计Grounded VideoDiT视频大语言模型，以克服现有模型在视频理解上的限制：1. 扩散时间潜变量（DTL）编码器提高边界敏感性和时间一致性；2. 基于对象的表示形式将查询实体与本地化视觉证据显式绑定，以增强对齐；3. 混合令牌方案，使用离散的时间令牌进行时间戳建模，实现细粒度的时间推理。

**Result:** 实验验证了Grounded VideoDiT在Charades STA、NExT GQA和多个VideoQA基准测试中的卓越性能，显示出强大的定位能力。

**Conclusion:** Grounded VideoDiT通过增强的时间感知和空间定位能力，证明了在视频理解和时间推理方面比现有模型更具优势。

**Abstract:** Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

> 本文提出了一种弱监督方法用于改善树木的实例分割，这种方法使用人工评估的初步分割结果来训练评分模型，并利用评分模型对分割模型进行微调，从而提高了分割准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 树木实例分割在基于航空激光扫描(ALS)数据的森林监测中非常重要，但数据受到传感器分辨率、获得时间的植被状况、地形特征等因素的影响，导致这一任务具有挑战性。另外，获取足够数量的精确标注数据来训练全监督实例分割方法成本高昂。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种基于弱监督的方法来解决数据标注昂贵的问题。首先，通过一个未经微调的模型或闭式算法获得初步分割结果，并由人工对结果进行质量评估。其次，评估中产生的标签用于训练一个评分模型，该模型的目标是将分割输出分类成与人工操作者指定的相同类别。最后，通过评分模型的反馈对分割模型进行微调。

**Result:** 通过这种方法，正确识别的树木实例的数量提高了34%，并且大大减少了预测的非树木实例数量。

**Conclusion:** 本文提出的方法有效地提高了树木实例分割的准确性，但在稀疏森林区域的数据处理上，特别是在存在小树（高度小于两米）或复杂环境（如灌木、岩石等）的情况下，其性能会有所下降。

**Abstract:** Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

*Shuchao Pang,Zhenghan Chen,Shen Zhang,Liming Lu,Siyuan Liang,Anan Du,Yongbin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

> The paper introduces CFG, a black-box adversarial attack method for 3D point clouds that enhances transferability by guiding the attack towards critical features, ensuring imperceptibility and outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to create a more effective, transfer-based adversarial attack method for 3D point clouds without needing detailed information about the target models, addressing a gap in current adversarial attack techniques.

**Method:** The method involves a regularized search for adversarial examples, which prioritizes modification of critical features across architectures and includes a constraint to maintain adversarial point cloud imperceptibility.

**Result:** Experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN show that the CFG method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art black-box attack methods.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that CFG effectively improves the transferability and imperceptibility of adversarial point clouds across different DNN architectures.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

**Motivation:** 旨在克服现有方法在自动驾驶系统中依赖过时离线地图和多种传感器套件带来的复杂计算开销，进而提高在线高精地图构建的效率。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为MapKD的新型多级跨模态知识蒸馏框架，采用教师-教练-学生（TCS）范式。该框架包括：（1）带有SD/HD地图先验知识的相机-LiDAR融合模型作为教师模型；（2）带有先验知识和模拟LiDAR的视觉中心教练模型，用于弥合跨模态知识转移间的差距；（3）轻量级的视觉学生模型。此外，还引入了两种针对性的知识蒸馏策略：Token-Guided 2D Patch Distillation（TGPD）用于鸟瞰视图特征对齐，Masked Semantic Response Distillation（MSRD）用于语义学习引导。

**Result:** 在挑战性的nuScenes数据集上的广泛实验表明，MapKD能提高学生模型的语义分割指标mIoU 6.68分，目标检测指标mAP 10.94分，同时加快推理速度。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果证明MapKD框架能够有效提高自动驾驶系统中驾驶地图的构建效率和精度。

**Abstract:** Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

**Motivation:** 为了提高大规模自动LoD3模型重建的效率，本文提出了一种新的方法。现有的LoD3模型生成需要手动建模，这使得大规模应用具有挑战性。本文的研究致力于自动化LoD3模型重建，为3D城市建模提供可扩展且高效的方案。

**Method:** CM2LoD3,利用从射线到模型先验分析获得的冲突地图（CMs）重建LoD3建筑模型的方法。通过使用语义冲突地图生成器（SCMG）生成的合成CMs对现实世界的CMs进行语义分割，并观察到通过使用置信度分数融合纹理模型的附加分割可以进一步提高分割性能，从而提高3D重建精度。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，CM2LoD3方法在分割和重建建筑开口方面有效，使用不确定性感知融合分割的建筑纹理性能达到61%。

**Conclusion:** 本研究有助于推进自动化LoD3模型重建的发展，为3D城市建模提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。项目代码公开可用。

**Abstract:** Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

**Motivation:** 动机是解决预训练视觉语言模型在类不均衡场景下的偏差累积问题，提出一种新方法来增强这些模型的微调效果，以适应不平衡的数据集。

**Method:** MDPR框架通过构建一个由五个视觉-语义维度组成的全面知识库，并采用动态路由机制在微调过程中进行全局视觉类别的对齐、最优提示的检索以及细粒度语义的平衡，以优化预训练视觉语言模型在类不均衡场景下的表现。

**Result:** 该论文提出了一种名为多维动态提示路由（MDPR）的框架，旨在解决预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）在类不均衡场景下进行微调时的偏差问题。MDPR构建了一个由五个视觉-语义维度组成的全面知识库，动态路由机制在微调过程中将全局视觉类别对齐，检索最优提示，并平衡细粒度语义，通过logits融合生成稳定预测。实验结果表明，MDPR在长尾基准数据集，如CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT上取得了与现有最先进（SOTA）方法相当的性能。消融研究表明，我们的语义库对尾类的有效性以及动态路由在微调过程中的低计算开销。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果证明了MDPR框架在处理长尾类别不均衡问题中的有效性，不仅能取得与当前最先进方法相当的性能，同时还能保持较低的计算开销。

**Abstract:** Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

> 文章介绍了一种名为StreamMem的方法，它能有效压缩查询无关的KV缓存以增强多模态大型语言模型处理长视频的效率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的多模态大型语言模型在处理长视频时效率低下，主要问题是存储和关注长期视觉上下文的KV缓存带来了较大的内存和计算开销。现有的视觉压缩方法要么需要在压缩前编码整个视觉上下文，要么需要提前知道问题，这在长视频理解和多轮对话环境中是不切实际的。

**Method:** 提出StreamMem，一种面向流式视频理解的查询无关KV缓存内存机制。StreamMem以流式方式编码新视频帧，并使用视觉标记和通用查询标记之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，同时保持固定大小的KV内存，以在内存受限和长视频场景中实现有效的问答。

**Result:** 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准上的评估表明，StreamMem在查询无关的KV缓存压缩方面达到了最先进的性能，且与查询感知压缩方法具有竞争力。

**Conclusion:** StreamMem通过压缩KV缓存，解决了多模态大型语言模型在处理长视频时遇到的内存和计算问题，并在多个基准测试中展示了出色的性能。

**Abstract:** Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

**Motivation:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation stems from the limitations of general vision foundation models in performing fine-grained semantic segmentation tasks, such as identifying specific nuclei subtypes or cells. This paper aims to develop a model that can overcome these limitations and provide precise segmentation results for biomedical images.

**Method:** In this paper, the authors propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to enhance computational pathology. It utilizes a full-stack approach focusing on three main aspects: (1) annotation, to engage lay annotators using molecular-empowered learning thus reducing the need for detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning, to adapt the SAM model for specific semantics using SAM adapter, and (3) refinement, to improve segmentation accuracy via Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL).

**Result:** Experimental results using both in-house and public datasets indicate a significant improvement in cell classification performance, even with varying quality of annotations.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method, All-in-SAM, not only reduces the workload on annotators but also broadens the accessibility of precise biomedical image analysis in resource-limited settings. It could advance medical diagnostics and facilitate automated pathology image analysis.

**Abstract:** Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

**Conclusion:** Waver表明其在视频生成上的卓越性能，并强调希望能帮助社区更高效地训练高质量的视频生成模型，加快视频生成技术的进步。

**Abstract:** We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial
Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming
existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art

> ATLAS is a new high-fidelity body model that uses a large dataset to decouple shape and skeleton, providing more detailed and accurate representations of human bodies in various poses and shapes, outperforming previous models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind ATLAS is to overcome the limitations of current human mesh modeling methods, such as the lack of detailed variations and problematic dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue. This is crucial for achieving more realistic and controllable representations of the human body.

**Method:** The method introduces ATLAS, a new parametric body model that decouples the shape and skeleton bases. This is achieved by learning from a large dataset of 600k high-resolution scans, using 240 synchronized cameras, which allows for more detailed and accurate representations of the human body across various poses and shapes.

**Result:** The results demonstrate that ATLAS outperforms existing models in fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses. Non-linear pose correctives are shown to be more effective in capturing complex poses than linear models, according to quantitative evaluations.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that ATLAS, due to its decoupling of shape and skeleton bases, provides enhanced shape expressivity and customization options. It also enables keypoint fitting independent of external soft tissue characteristics, leading to improved accuracy in diverse body poses.

**Abstract:** Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

**Abstract:** 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

*Qingyang Mao,Qi Cai,Yehao Li,Yingwei Pan,Mingyue Cheng,Ting Yao,Qi Liu,Tao Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

> The paper presents VAREdit, an autoregressive model for precise and efficient image editing, which outperforms diffusion models by incorporating a Scale-Aligned Reference module to effectively condition source image tokens during multi-scale feature generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind VAREdit is to overcome the inherent limitations of diffusion models in instruction-guided image editing, where the global denoising process can lead to unintended modifications and poor adherence to instructions. By contrast, autoregressive models, by treating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete tokens, offer a natural solution to these adherence challenges.

**Method:** The paper introduces VAREdit, an autoregressive framework for image editing. This framework treats image editing as a sequential prediction task, generating multi-scale target features based on source image features and text instructions. To address a key challenge in this approach, which is to effectively condition the source image tokens, the authors developed a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module. This module injects scale-matched conditioning information at the first self-attention layer, enhancing the prediction of coarser target features from finer source features.

**Result:** The results indicate that VAREdit achieves both higher efficiency and better adherence to editing instructions. It outperforms diffusion models by over 30% in GPT-Balance score on standard benchmarks. Additionally, VAREdit completes a 512x512 image editing task in 1.2 seconds, which is 2.2 times faster than a similarly-sized diffusion model.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes by highlighting VAREdit's superior performance in both the quality and speed of image editing. This is supported by improved adherence to editing instructions and faster editing times compared to diffusion models. The authors also make the models available for further research and application.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

> 该论文介绍了一种可扩展的组推理方法，旨在提高生成模型输出的一组样本的多样性和质量，通过图节点优化样本质量和组多样性，并在多个任务中展示了显著效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 生成模型通常独立采样输出，但在实际应用中，用户常需要一套包括多个图像的样本集，独立采样会导致结果冗余，限制用户选择并阻碍探索。

**Method:** 将组推理制定为一个二次整数分配问题，使用候选输出作为图节点，并选择一个子集以优化样本质量和组多样性。为了提高运行效率，使用中间预测进行逐步候选集剪枝。

**Result:** 实验表明，这种方法在多样性和质量上显著优于独立采样基准和其他推断算法。

**Conclusion:** 该框架适用于广泛的任务，如文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成，使得生成模型能够将多个输出视为一个统一的组。

**Abstract:** Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Main category: cs.CV

> 提出CineScale，一种新的推理范式，用于解决高分辨率生成中重复模式的问题，同时扩展图像到视频和视频到视频合成的能力。无需微调实现了8k图像生成，只需少量微调即可实现4k视频生成。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的视觉扩散模型通常在有限的分辨率下训练，因为缺乏高分辨率数据和计算资源的限制，这阻碍了它们生成更高分辨率的高质量图像或视频的能力。先前的努力尝试了无调优策略来挖掘预训练模型在更高分辨率视觉生成中的潜力，但仍容易产生有重复模式的低质量视觉内容。关键障碍在于当模型生成超出其训练分辨率的视觉内容时，高频信息不可避免地增加，导致累积误差。

**Method:** CineScale, 一种新的推理范式，旨在实现更高分辨率的视觉生成，特别针对两种类型的视频生成架构提出了专门的变体。这种方法不是受限于高分辨率的文本到图像和文本到视频生成，还扩展到高分辨率的图像到视频和视频到视频合成，基于最先进的开源视频生成框架。

**Result:** 广泛的实验验证了我们的范式在扩展高分辨率视觉生成能力方面的优越性。值得注意的是，该方法无需微调就能实现8k图像生成，并且只需最小的LoRA微调就能实现4k视频生成。生成的视频样本可以在我们的网站上找到：https://eyeline-labs.github.io/CineScale/。

**Conclusion:** CineScale通过专门针对两种视频生成架构的变体，提供了一种新的推理范式，解决了高频信息增加导致的重复模式问题。这种方法超越了现有方法，不仅在文本到图像和文本到视频生成方面表现优秀，还扩展到了图像到视频和视频到视频合成，成功实现了高分辨率的视觉内容生成。

**Abstract:** Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:
