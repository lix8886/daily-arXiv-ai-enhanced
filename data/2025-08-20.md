Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种扩展的行为者级别管道，用于检测和缓解大规模文本语料库中的性别歧视问题。通过分析德国报纸文章语料库taz2024full，展示了在多个语言维度上显著提高性别平衡的能力，但同时指出细微偏见（如情绪和框架）的持续存在。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 随着大型语言模型对数字交流的影响日益增加，这些模型生成的文本往往反映出从训练数据中继承的结构性性别不平衡。为了应对这一问题，提高语料库的公平性，本文提供了一种解决方案。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种扩展的行为者级别管道，该管道引入了新的行为者级别指标，包括情绪、句法主动性和引用风格的不对称性，涵盖了诊断语料库分析和排除平衡两个方面。

**Result:** 成果应用于德国报纸taz2024full语料库中，展示了在多个语言维度上提高性别平衡的显著成效。同时也发现表面不平衡可以通过过滤和重新平衡来解决，但情绪和框架等细微偏见仍然存在。

**Conclusion:** 本文结果表明虽然表面不平衡可以通过手动过滤和重新平衡来解决，但更为微妙的情绪和框架偏见仍然存在，需要进一步的研究。同时，作者公开了相关工具和报告，以支持基于话语的公平审计和公平语料库构建。

**Abstract:** Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

*Zeeshan Ahmed,Frank Seide,Niko Moritz,Ju Lin,Ruiming Xie,Simone Merello,Zhe Liu,Christian Fuegen*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种新的同时翻译方法，解决了实时翻译中的挑战，展示了在内置设备上实现双向对话翻译的潜力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 该论文旨在解决将自动语音识别(ASR)和机器翻译(MT)结合用于实时、内置流式语音翻译时遇到的挑战。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种同时翻译方法，有效平衡了翻译质量和延迟。研究了ASR和MT的高效集成，利用ASR系统生成的语言线索来管理上下文，并采用高效的束搜索剪枝技术（如超时和强制最终化）来维持系统的实时因素。

**Result:** 该方法应用于双向对话语音翻译中，实验结果表明，该技术在延迟和质量方面优于基线技术，且显著缩小了与非流式翻译系统的质量差距。

**Conclusion:** 本文证明了所提出的技术提高了实时语音翻译的准确性和效率，为未来的实时语音翻译系统铺平了道路。

**Abstract:** This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

### [4] [Stands to Reason: Investigating the Effect of Reasoning on Idiomaticity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13365)
*Dylan Phelps,Rodrigo Wilkens,Edward Gow-Smith,Thomas Pickard,Maggie Mi,Aline Villavicencio*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）推理能力对习语识别性能的影响以及模型规模的影响。研究使用了DeepSeek-R1系列的不同规模的模型来评估它们在四个习语识别数据集上的表现。结果表明，推理能力的增强对习语识别的表现影响不如预期的那么显著，大型模型理解习语的能力更好，而小型模型则受益于提供定义的提示改善了性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 随着推理模型的利用，大型语言模型在涉及逻辑步骤的任务中性能有所提高，尤其是习语识别这类需要对表达进行初步理解的任务。因此，本研究旨在探索LLMs在习语识别任务中的推理能力以及模型大小对其性能的影响。

**Method:** 研究方法采用评估不同参数量的DeepSeek-R1小型模型系列（从1.5B到70B）在四个习语识别数据集上的表现，探索模型大小与推理能力对习语识别任务的效果。此外，还研究了在提示中小型模型中提供定义能否改善其性能。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，推理能力的增强对习语识别性能的影响小于预期，并且这种影响在不同大小的模型中差异较大。相对于非中间模型，小型模型通过链式思考（CoT）推理增强了性能，但未达到基准模型的水平。大型模型在习语理解上表现出色，并成功做出了准确的表达定义，而小型模型则时常无法输出表达的实际含义。

**Conclusion:** 结论指出，考虑到大型模型在习语理解上的优势，提供了精确定义的提示可以改善小型模型的习语识别性能。因此，研究得出在特定情况下，提供定义的提示对小型模型有效。

**Abstract:** The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

### [5] [Whispering Context: Distilling Syntax and Semantics for Long Speech Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13376)
*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种通过将LLaMA的上下文知识蒸馏到Whisper来改进ASR的方法，在长音频转录任务中取得了显著的性能提升。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** ASR系统在处理长音频转录时，经常难以保持语法和语义的准确性，这影响了命名实体识别（NER）、大小写和标点符号等任务。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种创新的方法，通过将LLaMA模型中的上下文知识蒸馏到Whisper中来增强ASR系统。我们的方法采用了两种策略：(1) 使用最优传输在标记级别进行蒸馏，以对齐维度和序列长度；(2) 最小化Whisper和LLaMA之间句子嵌入的表示损失，融合句法和语义。

**Result:** 在长音频和丰富实体的Spoken Wikipedia基准数据集上的评估显示，我们的方法在单词错误率（WER）、NER、大小写和标点符号的成功率方面取得了显著改进。

**Conclusion:** 通过引入新的NER度量标准和探讨语义感知的ASR，我们的研究强调了将语言背景融入转录的价值，为长篇语音的稳健、上下文感知的ASR奠定了基础。

**Abstract:** ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

### [6] [Datarus-R1: An Adaptive Multi-Step Reasoning LLM for Automated Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13382)
*Ayoub Ben Chaliah,Hela Dellagi*

Main category: cs.CL

> Datarus-R1-14B是一种新型虚拟数据分析师模型，在研究生水平的问题和公共基准测试中表现出色，其方法独特，大幅提升了准确率且减少了输出冗余。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 动机在于开发一种能够高效执行数据分析和解决复杂问题的语言模型，在提高模型准确率的同时减少输出冗余。

**Method:** 本文介绍了Datarus-R1-14B，一个基于Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct的140亿参数的语言模型，被训练用于充当虚拟数据分析师和研究生水平的问题解决者。模型训练采用了一个包含推理步骤、代码执行、错误追踪、自我修正和最终结论的分析轨迹，使用了反应式笔记本格式进行训练，涵盖金融、医疗、数值分析等定量领域。训练管道结合了一个侧重轨迹的合成数据生成器、一个将轻量级标签结构信号与分层奖励模型(HRM)结合的双重奖励框架，以及一个内存优化的组相对策略优化(GRPO)实现。

**Result:** 该模型在研究生水平的问题上表明了一个“AHA时刻”模式，即它先勾画出假设，然后进行一次或两次修正，最后收敛，避免了当代系统中常见的循环、冗长的输出。在标准公共基准测试中，Datarus超过了类似的相同规模模型，甚至达到了更大规模推理模型如QwQ-32B的水平，在AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench上提高了高达30%的准确率，同时每个解决方案的输出令牌减少18-49%。

**Conclusion:** Datarus模型在解决问题时展现了高效和准确性的改善，证明了其在实际问题解决中的潜力，尤其是在减少冗余和提高准确性方面。

**Abstract:** We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

### [7] [ALIGN: Word Association Learning for Cross-Cultural Generalization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13426)
*Chunhua Liu,Kabir Manandhar Shrestha,Sukai Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

> 参数效率的微调方法可以低成本地增强大语言模型的文化对齐，通过使用小世界词汇项目中的词汇联想数据提升了跨文化交流的语言模型的文化理解能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究动机在于解决大语言模型在跨文化交流中反映出的语言和观点的分布偏差问题，尤其是在文化知识有限和有效学习方法探索不足的情况下。

**Method:** 通过在小世界词汇项目（Small-World-of-Words）中基于英语美国和汉语词汇联想的参数有效的微调来进行研究，同时采用有监督微调（SFT）和PPO（基于偏好的优化）对Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B进行适应性调整。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，与原始模型相比，微调后的模型在持有词汇联想的精度上提升了16-20%（英语），43-165%（汉语），平均具体性提升了+0.20，并且达到了人类水平的情绪和唤醒水平。在世界价值观调查问题上，微调后的模型答案分布更接近目标文化。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，用少量文化相关的联想可以有效地调整大语言模型的文化对齐，而无需昂贵的重新训练。这凸显了基于人类认知的研究和未来研究的必要性以改进AI模型中的文化对齐。

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

*Hongxin Ding,Baixiang Huang,Yue Fang,Weibin Liao,Xinke Jiang,Zheng Li,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

> 提出ProMed框架，利用SIG奖励机制训练医疗模型主动提出有价值的问题，提升问诊准确性和适应性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于医疗大语言模型主要采用反应范式，无法主动获取患者信息，这在互动场景下可能导致诊断错误。因此提出ProMed框架来改进这一问题。

**Method:** ProMed框架结合强化学习（RL）使医疗大语言模型从反应性范式转向主动性范式，通过提出Shapley信息增益（SIG）奖励来量化每个问题的临床效用，并整合SIG奖励进行模型初始化和策略优化。

**Result:** 在两个新的具有部分信息的医疗基准测试上，ProMed显著优于当前最优方法，并且有效提高了问题的临床价值和决策准确性。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，ProMed相比现有方法平均提高了6.29%，而在具有部分信息的医疗基准测试中，相比反应性范式提高了54.45%，并且能够更稳健地推广到域外案例。

**Abstract:** Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

### [9] [Saudi-Dialect-ALLaM: LoRA Fine-Tuning for Dialectal Arabic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13525)
*Hassan Barmandah*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究通过LoRA微调方式，使用私有的沙特方言指令数据集对ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview模型进行了训练，提高了沙特方言Najdi和Hijazi的生成能力和准确性，达到了比其他通用指令模型更好的效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于现有的大型语言模型主要支持标准阿拉伯语，而对沙特方言支持不足，研究旨在通过微调提升沙特方言的生成能力，并确保其多样性和准确性。

**Method:** 研究采用了LoRA技术对ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview进行微调，使用包含了5466个合成指令响应配对的沙特方言数据集，包括Dialect-Token和No-Token两种训练方式。

**Result:** Dialect-Token训练方式提高了阿拉伯语方言生成的控制能力，将方言率从47.97%提高到了84.21%，显著降低了标准阿拉伯语的比例；同时，文本保真度也有所提升。

**Conclusion:** 与其它较强的通用指令模型相比，LoRA微调得到的模型在方言控制和保真度方面表现更优，并且避免了基线模型常见的元数据标签回声问题。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

*Chalamalasetti Kranti,Sowmya Vajjala*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本研究提出MATA数据集评估大型语言模型在泰卢固语上的能力，分析了11种模型的表现，揭示了其问题并探讨了其在低资源语言中的评估可靠性，强调了细粒度评估的重要性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 旨在通过MATA数据集评估多种大型语言模型在泰卢固语上的表现，揭示其依赖于表面启发式（如答案位置和干扰选项模式）的问题，并探索在资源较少的语言中使用大型语言模型作为评估者进行评估的可靠性。

**Method:** 本研究引入了一个名为MATA的新评估数据集，用于评估大型语言模型在泰卢固语中的能力。该数据集包含729个精心策划的多项选择题和开放式问题，涵盖了多种语言维度。

**Result:** 研究表明，大型语言模型在处理多项选择题时依赖于表面启发式方法，而将大型语言模型作为评估者与人类评估者在开放式问题上的比较显示了其在资源较少的语言中的可靠性。

**Conclusion:** 这样的细粒度评估对理解模型的局限性至关重要，并能为开发更具语言能力的大型语言模型提供指导，同时也为未来泰卢固语自然语言处理的研究奠定了基础。

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

*Rohit Raj Rai,Chirag Kothari,Siddhesh Shelke,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.CL

> 该研究提出了评估压缩模型可信度等效性的框架，并发现即使精度相近，大型模型及其压缩变体在可解释性和校准相似性上存在显著差异。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 探讨压缩模型的预测是否像大型模型一样值得信赖，发现性能一致性并不保证可信度等效性。

**Method:** 提出二维框架来评估模型的可信度等效性：第一，可解释性对齐，采用LIME和SHAP测试来衡量；第二，校准相似性，采用ECE、MCE、Brier Score和可靠性图评估。

**Result:** 实验结果揭示了低可解释性对齐度和校准相似性的显著偏差，表明压缩模型并不等同于大型模型。

**Conclusion:** 部署压缩模型需要进行谨慎评估，不能仅依赖性能一致性。

**Abstract:** Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

### [12] [A Comparative Study of Decoding Strategies in Medical Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13580)
*Oriana Presacan,Alireza Nik,Vajira Thambawita,Bogdan Ionescu,Michael Riegler*

Main category: cs.CL

> Study on decoding strategies in medical LLMs shows deterministic methods outperform stochastic ones; model size and specialization matter less than careful decoding strategy selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To explore the under-researched impact of decoding strategies on LLM performance in healthcare, where accuracy is paramount.

**Method:** We investigate the impact of decoding strategies on the performance of LLMs in five medical tasks using 11 different decoding strategies with both specialized medical and general LLMs.

**Result:** Deterministic decoding strategies, such as beam search, outperform stochastic methods. Larger models score higher but have longer inference times and similar vulnerability to decoding strategy. Medical LLMs outperform general ones in two tasks but show greater sensitivity to decoding method.

**Conclusion:** The choice of decoding strategy is critical in medical applications and can have a greater impact than the model choice itself. Evaluation metrics vary in their correlation with each other and sensitivity to decoding strategies.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究动机在于探讨语音大模型与文本大模型在性别偏见方面是否存在相似性。不同于文本模型中隐含的性别关联，语音模型会产生具体的性别声调，讲者选择成为一种显性的偏见线索。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种利用讲者分配作为分析工具来调查偏见的方法论。通过分析Bark（一种文本到语音转换模型）在给定文本提示时选择的默认讲者，来探讨其是否体现出性别偏见。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，尽管Bark模型并不表现出系统性的性别偏见，但显示出了一定的性别意识及倾向。

**Conclusion:** 研究结论指出，尽管Bark模型在性别偏见方面不表现出系统性偏差，但它仍然显示出一定的性别意识与性别倾向，这可能反映了其训练数据或模型设计中的某种模式。

**Abstract:** Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决文档视觉问答（Document VQA）在处理长文档时面临的挑战，特别是在低资源环境下的上下文限制和训练数据不足的问题。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为AdaDocVQA的统一自适应框架，该框架通过三种核心创新解决了低资源环境下处理长文档的挑战：1. 混合文本检索架构实现了有效的文档分割；2. 智能数据增强流水线能自动生成高质量的问题答案对，并进行多级验证；3. 自适应集合推理，包括动态配置生成和提前停止机制。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，该框架在Japanese document VQA基准测试中表现出显著改进，具体为：在JDocQA数据集上，是/否问题的准确率为83.04％，事实问题的准确率为52.66％，数值问题的准确率为44.12%；在LAVA数据集上，准确率为59%。

**Conclusion:** 该框架在JDocQA基准上的准确率分别为83.04％（是/否问题），52.66％（事实问题）和44.12％（数值问题），在LAVA数据集上准确率为59％，证实了各部分的重要贡献，并为其他低资源语言和专门领域提供了一个可扩展的基础。

**Abstract:** Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) faces significant
challenges when processing long documents in low-resource environments due to
context limitations and insufficient training data. This paper presents
AdaDocVQA, a unified adaptive framework addressing these challenges through
three core innovations: a hybrid text retrieval architecture for effective
document segmentation, an intelligent data augmentation pipeline that
automatically generates high-quality reasoning question-answer pairs with
multi-level verification, and adaptive ensemble inference with dynamic
configuration generation and early stopping mechanisms. Experiments on Japanese
document VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements with 83.04\%
accuracy on Yes/No questions, 52.66\% on factual questions, and 44.12\% on
numerical questions in JDocQA, and 59\% accuracy on LAVA dataset. Ablation
studies confirm meaningful contributions from each component, and our framework
establishes new state-of-the-art results for Japanese document VQA while
providing a scalable foundation for other low-resource languages and
specialized domains. Our code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 随着大型语言模型(LLMs)越来越多地被部署在实际应用中，选择性地移除不必要的知识同时保持模型效用的需求变得至关重要。现有的基于稀疏自编码器(SAE)的方法通常在推理时进行干预，这不会对模型参数产生持久变化，并且容易被恶意行为者绕过或逆转。

**Method:** CRISP是一种使用稀疏自编码器(SAE)的参数高效方法，旨在持久地实现概念的取消学习。它自动识别多个层中的显著SAE特征并抑制这些特征的激活。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，相比于先前的方法，CRISP在WMDP基准中的安全关键取消学习任务上表现更优，成功地移除了有害知识，同时保持了模型的通用性和领域内能力。

**Conclusion:** CRISP通过在特征级别的分析显示出对目标和良性概念在语义上的连贯分离，实现了精确地抑制目标特征。

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 鉴于视觉语言模型在英语多模态任务中的卓越表现，而对于资源匮乏的语言和真正多模态教育内容的性能尚未进行充分研究，因此本研究旨在评估英语数据训练的VLMs在越南语多模态推理中的表现。

**Method:** 本研究通过提出一个名为ViExam的基准测试，包含了2,548个多模态问题，首次全面评估了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在越南语教育评估中的表现。

**Result:** 研究结果显示，最先进的VLMs在ViExam中的平均准确率为57.74%，而开源模型的准确率为27.70%，均低于普通人类考试参与者的表现（66.54%）。

**Conclusion:** 英语指令的跨语言提示未能改善性能，反而使SOTA VLMs的准确性下降了1个百分点。人类参与的合作可以部分改善VLMs的表现，提升5个百分点。

**Abstract:** Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本研究的动机是探讨大型语言模型在处理涉及泛化常识的非强制性推理模式方面的表现，以了解这些模型在处理默认推理问题时的能力和限制。

**Method:** 评估28个大型语言模型（LLMs）处理20种涉及泛化常识（如'鸟类会飞'、'乌鸦是黑色的'）的非强制性推理模式的能力。这些泛化常识对于语言学家、哲学家、逻辑学家和认知科学家来说尤为重要，因为它们具有复杂的例外允许行为，并且是默认推理、认知和概念获取的核心。

**Result:** 研究发现，虽然几个前沿模型在处理许多默认推理问题时表现良好，但模型的表现和提示风格之间存在很大差异。少样本提示适度提高了某些模型的表现，但链式思维（CoT）提示通常导致性能大幅下降（平均准确率下降-11.14%，标准差15.74%，在零样本条件下，性能高于75%的模型，温度0）。大多数模型要么难以区分非强制性推理和演绎推理，要么错误地将泛化常识解释为普遍陈述。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现强调了当前LLMs在默认推理中的潜力和局限性。

**Abstract:** This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 深入理解深度学习模型中隐含编码的知识对于提升AI系统的可解释性至关重要。本文旨在探讨目前用于解释词嵌入中编码知识的常见方法的有效性，从而质疑这些方法的合理性和局限性。

**Method:** 此论文挑战了一种假设，即词嵌入能够准确预测语义特征意味着嵌入中确实包含了对应的语义知识。为检验这一假设，作者展示了预测准确性高的词嵌入可能只是反映出向量空间中的几何相似性，而非真实的语义特性。

**Result:** 研究表明，预测方法可以成功地预测随机信息，这意味着结果主要是由算法的上限决定的，而非词嵌入中的语义表征。因此，仅基于预测性能来比较数据集不能可靠地表明哪个数据集被词嵌入更好地表征。

**Conclusion:** 词嵌入中的语义表征评价方法主要反映的是向量空间内的几何相似性，而非语义特征的实际涌现。这意味着我们需要重新考虑现有评估方法，以更准确地衡量词嵌入中的语义特性。

**Abstract:** Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

**Motivation:** 随着EEG在神经科学和临床实践中的广泛应用，高效地检索和语义解释大规模、多源、异构的EEG数据已成为一个紧迫的挑战。

**Method:** 我们提出了EEG-MedRAG，这是一个基于三层超图的检索增强生成框架，将EEG领域的知识、个人病历和大规模仓库数据整合成一个可遍历的n-元关系超图，实现联合语义-时间检索和因果链诊断生成。同时，我们还引入了首个跨疾病、跨角色的EEG临床问答基准。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，我们的框架能在跨疾病和多角色的临床环境中实现高准确的问答，为未来的临床决策提供了强有力的工具支持。数据和代码已公开。

**Abstract:** With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

**Motivation:** 解决大语言模型在科学问答中因用户偏好对齐技术产生的随从行为问题，这种行为可能导致模型输出不正确的信息，尤其是在高风险的科学问答领域。

**Method:** 提出统一的评估框架来量化随从性上下文对模型行为的影响，这个框架包括对抗性提示设置和专门的指标，如误导抵抗力和随从性抵抗力，同时还提出了轻量级的后训练方法Pressure-Tune。

**Result:** <tool_call>

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，Pressure-Tune可以在不损害准确性或对有效反馈的响应能力的情况下，显著增强模型的随从抵抗力，为更真实的模型行为提供了实用路径。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the poor domain generalization of current MGT detectors due to domain shifts between data from different sources, by observing consistent spectral patterns across domains where MGT and HWTs differ in magnitude.

**Method:** The paper proposes MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method that analyzes text representations in the frequency domain and includes a low frequency domain filtering module and a dynamic spectrum alignment strategy.

**Result:** Experiments show MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

**Conclusion:** MGT-Prism effectively enhances the capability of Machine-Generated Text detection in unseen domains through frequency domain analysis, providing improved accuracy and robustness.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管大型语言模型在教育中的作用日益增加，但很少有人关注LLM生成的文本是否类似于儿童语言。这项研究旨在填补这一知识空白。

**Method:** 本研究通过比较大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的文本与一组德语儿童对图片故事的描述来评估LLMs如何复制儿童语言。研究生成了两个基于LLMs的语料库：一个是零样本提示生成的，另一个是少量样本提示（指定了儿童语料库中的一般年龄）生成的。研究中分析了多种心理语言学文本特征，包括词频、词汇丰富度、句子和单词长度、词性标注和词嵌入的语义相似性。

**Result:** 研究结果显示，LLMs生成的文本较长但词汇丰富度较低，更多地依赖高频单词并且名词使用较少。语义向量空间分析揭示了两者在语料库语义层面的低相似性。少量样本提示的方法在一定程度上增加了儿童文本和LLMs文本之间的相似性，但仍未复制出词汇和语义模式。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现有助于我们了解LLMs通过多模态提示（文本+图像）如何近似儿童语言，并为心理语言学研究和教育中的使用提供见解，同时提出了关于在面向儿童的教育工具中使用LLM生成语言的适当性的重要问题。

**Abstract:** The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

**Method:** 文中介绍了一种新的可追溯的、基于方面的总结基准——TracSum，以及一个总结管道Track-Then-Sum作为基线方法。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，显式地执行句子级别的跟踪总结可以提高生成的准确性，而加入完整上下文可以进一步提高摘要的完整性。

**Conclusion:** TracSum可以有效地作为一个可追溯的、基于方面的总结任务的基准。

**Abstract:** While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

**Method:** 通过大规模的贝叶斯评估，研究了市场上的顶级语言模型对道德维度的理解能力，并与人类进行了对比。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，顶级语言模型（如Claude Sonnet 4，DeepSeek-V3，Llama 4 Maverick）通常能够排名在人类注释者的前25%，达到了平均以上的平衡准确性，尤其在减少假阴性方面表现优于人类，显示出其更敏感的道德检测能力。

**Conclusion:** 该研究展示了大规模贝叶斯评估框架的有效性，并且揭示了人工智能模型在检测道德维度上的高准确性和敏感性，优于大多数人类注释者。

**Abstract:** How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 控制大型语言模型生成文本的长度一直是一个挑战，这些模型常常偏离指定的长度要求。本文旨在通过一种方法使模型能够准确地生成指定数量的文本标记或字符。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种基于提示的单次策略，使现成的语言模型（LLM）能够生成精确数量的标记或字符，而无需任何微调或迭代采样。提示增加了倒计数标记和明确的计数规则，使模型在生成文本时同时进行计数。

**Result:** 在MT-Bench-LI数据集上进行的严格长度合规性测试中，当使用传统的提示时，GPT-4.1的合规率不足30%，而使用本文的方法后，合规率超过了95%，并且保持了答案质量。

**Conclusion:** 这些结果显示，通过提示工程可以实现对文本长度的精确控制，提供了一种轻量级的训练或解码方法的替代方案。

**Abstract:** Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

**Motivation:** 自然语言生成评估对于AI的实际应用至关重要，但一直是研究挑战。本文旨在展示尽管自动评估指标已经从简单的词法比较发展到基于大语言模型的评估者，但没有单一指标成为确定的解决方案。

**Method:** 本文通过详尽分析现有自动评估指标的方法、已知的优势和限制、验证方法以及与人类评价的相关性来探讨自然语言生成评估的挑战。

**Result:** 研究发现，这些挑战在最新的LLM-as-a-Judge指标和检索增强生成任务评估中仍然存在。

**Conclusion:** 本文挑战了寻找'完美指标'的追求，并建议根据特定任务需求选择指标，利用互补性评价方法，并提出新的指标应该专注于改进验证方法。

**Abstract:** Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

**Abstract:** This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge
graph in future work to further enhance automatic verification systems.

> 提出MME-SCI作为多模态大型语言模型评估的新基准，填补现有测试的不足，提高了评估的挑战性并提供了详细的表现分析。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 文章旨在解决现有的多模态大型语言模型评估基准在多语言推理能力评估不足、模态覆盖不充分和科学知识点标注不够精细的三个关键挑战。

**Method:** MME-SCI 通过收集1019个高质量的问题-答案对，涵盖了数学、物理、化学和生物四个学科，并支持中文、英文、法文、西班牙文和日文五种语言。评估了包括16个开源模型和4个闭源模型的性能。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，在仅图像评估模式下，各种模型在各学科中的表现低于预期。比如o4-mini模型在数学、物理、化学和生物四个学科中的准确率分别为52.11%、24.73%、36.57%和29.80%，这表明MME-SCI相比现有基准更具挑战性。

**Conclusion:** MME-SCI 提出了一项全面且具有挑战性的基准测试，能够评估多模态大型语言模型在多语言和跨学科背景下的推理能力，填补了现有基准测试在这些方面的不足。实验结果表明，MME-SCI 对现有的多模态大型语言模型具有较高的挑战性，并为未来研究提供了方向。

**Abstract:** Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

**Abstract:** In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We
will share ReviewGraph output and platform open-sourced on our GitHub page

**Motivation:** 现有的合成数据微调LLMs以增强其长文本处理能力的方法限于数据多样性和事实准确性的缺乏，因此需要一种新的方法来提高长文本模型的有效性。

**Method:** 提出LongMab-PO框架，通过多臂赌博机（MAB）策略来选择最具有信息量的长文本片段，从而增强大规模语言模型（LLMs）在长文本任务中的表现。在该框架中，通过基于预期回报评分选择文本片段输入LLMs生成响应，并根据奖励反馈迭代更新这些评分，以此提高生成响应的质量和多样性。

**Result:** 实验表明，LongMab-PO显著提高了偏好数据对的多样性和质量，在长文本推理基准测试中达到当前最优水平。

**Conclusion:** LongMab-PO框架通过改进长文本处理中的信息选取和响应生成过程，有效提升了响应的质量和多样性，并在长文本推理任务中取得了显著成果。

**Abstract:** Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

> 本文针对RLVR训练中的策略熵下降问题，引入了在线自博弈与变分问题合成（SvS）策略。该策略不仅有效维持了策略熵，同时也显著提升了LLM在多个推理任务上的整体性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文动机在于解决原始RLVR训练中存在的策略熵下降问题，该问题导致生成多样性减少，限制了通过率@k的表现，而通过率@k通常代表了LLM推理能力的上限。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种在线自博弈与变分问题合成（SvS）策略，该策略利用策略的正确解决方案来合成变分问题，同时保证其参考答案与原问题相同，从而在训练过程中有效维持策略熵，并显著提高通过率@k性能。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，在竞争级别的AIME24和AIME25基准测试中，与标准RLVR相比，SvS策略在通过率@32性能方面分别取得了18.3%和22.8%的绝对提升。此外，该策略在12个推理基准测试中表现出良好的泛化性和鲁棒性，适用于3B到32B不同规模的模型。

**Conclusion:** 研究结论表明，通过在线自博弈与变分问题合成（SvS）策略，不仅能够解决原始RLVR训练策略熵下降带来的问题，还能提供更好的生成多样性和推理能力，表现出良好的泛化性和鲁棒性。

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

> 本文提出了一种名为前缀注入防护（PING）的方法，用于在大型语言模型的微调过程中解决安全问题。PING通过添加自然语言前缀来确保模型在面对有害请求时能够拒绝，而不会影响其在良性任务中的表现，实验表明它在一个广泛的基准测试中显著提高了安全性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 随着大型语言模型（LLM）演进为能够规划和使用外部工具解决复杂任务的智能体系统，基于任务对LLM进行微调以提升其能力也成为了一种趋势。然而，在这个微调过程中，安全问题往往被忽视。本文指出了对齐后的LLM在执行任务微调时可能会无意中偏离对齐，增加了执行有害任务的可能性，并降低了拒绝这些任务的倾向。

**Method:** 我们提出了前缀注入防护（PING）机制，这是一种简单而有效的方法，通过在智能体响应之前自动添加自然语言前缀来引导其拒绝有害请求，同时保持对良性任务的性能。特别地，我们引入了一种迭代方法，该方法在生成候选前缀和选择那些优化任务性能和拒绝行为的前缀之间交替进行。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，PING显著提高了细调后LLM智能体的安全性，而不会牺牲其有效性。PING在网页导航和代码生成任务的各类基准测试中始终优于现有的提示方法。

**Conclusion:** 通过线性探测分析内部隐藏状态，我们发现前缀令牌对于行为修改至关重要，解释了性能提升的原因。总体而言，PING提供了一种基础性的方法来增强LLM在任务微调过程中安全性的同时保持其有效性。

**Abstract:** Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 数字健康分析面临了严峻的挑战，特别是在处理复杂的情绪和医疗上下文时需要稀缺的领域专业知识，而传统的机器学习方法由于数据短缺和健康照护环境中的隐私限制而受到限制。在线健康社区（OHCs）对于情感分析提出了进一步的挑战，要求专门的知识，因为这些社区包含复杂的情绪表达和临床术语。

**Method:** 研究开发了一个有系统的编码本，该编码本系统地编码了专家解读指南，使大型语言模型能够通过针对性的提示来应用特定领域的知识，而不是进行大规模训练。通过这种方式，基于大型语言模型的方法能够集成专家知识，针对情感分析提供了一个可扩展的解决方案。

**Result:** 研究中的六个GPT模型、DeepSeek和LLaMA 3.1模型对比了预训练语言模型（如BioBERT变体）和基于词典的方法，结果显示LLMs在400个专家注释的OHC帖子中表现出色，并且展现出与专家级别的高度一致。

**Conclusion:** 研究提出的方法解决了数字健康研究中专家知识短缺的关键挑战，提供了用于实时、专家品质的患者监控、干预评估和基于证据的健康策略的解决方案。这种方法表明，通过进行上下文学习的大型语言模型，可以在没有显著统计差异的情况下达成高级专家解读的一致性，从而超越了表面层次的模式识别。

**Abstract:** Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

> The paper proposes YOLO11-CR, an efficient object detection model for real-time driver fatigue monitoring, improving on state-of-the-art methods with enhanced feature expression and spatial localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** This paper aims to address limitations in current driver fatigue detection methods, which are either intrusive or face challenges like poor detection of small or occluded objects.

**Method:** YOLO11-CR introduces two key modules: CAFM integrates local CNN features with Transformer-based context to enhance feature expressiveness; RCM captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial localization.

**Result:** Experiments on the DSM dataset showed YOLO11-CR outperformed baselines on precision, recall, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95.

**Conclusion:** YOLO11-CR provides a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue monitoring, promising for real-world deployment with potential for future enhancements.

**Abstract:** Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

**Abstract:** The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

> This paper introduces DianJin-OCR-R1, a reasoning-enhanced method that uses a vision-language model with tailored expert models for OCR to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations on document images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this work is to enhance the capabilities of VLMs in OCR tasks by reducing the likelihood of generating non-existent words (hallucinations) and improving accuracy compared to general-purpose VLMs.

**Method:** DianJin-OCR-R1 is a reasoning-enhanced framework designed to improve Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks using a combination of vision-language model (VLM) capabilities and expert OCR models. It addresses limitations in VLMs, such as generating non-existent words and lower accuracy on specific OCR tasks compared to models trained on domain-specific datasets.

**Result:** DianJin-OCR-R1 was evaluated on ReST and OmniDocBench datasets, where it outperformed non-reasoning VLMs and expert OCR models, demonstrating its effectiveness.

**Conclusion:** The proposed DianJin-OCR-R1 framework effectively leverages reasoning and outputs from tailored expert models to mitigate limitations of vision-language models in OCR tasks, thus providing better performance and reliability.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 乌尔都语是一种连贯的书写语言，字母结构复杂，使得字符分类非常困难。传统的基于分割的方法由于语言的上下文敏感性，往往会有很高的错误率。

**Method:** 本文采用了一种基于组件分类的方法，应用自动特征学习技术（卷积神经网络）来识别乌尔都语字符。此外，采用分层神经网络结构来处理不同度的字符组合，使用连接组件技术来进一步处理数据集以剔除不必要图像，只保留连字符。

**Result:** 实验表明，模型在组件分类上实现了0.99%的成功率。

**Conclusion:** 该系统在处理乌尔都语字符识别任务时表现出了高度的准确性。

**Abstract:** Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

> CLoE, a curriculum learning framework for MES classification in ulcerative colitis, uses image quality estimation to handle label noise, improving ordinal classification under uncertain labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** MES classification for ulcerative colitis is challenging due to label noise from inter-observer variability and ordinal score nature, which standard models fail to adequately address. This paper aims to improve MES classification under label uncertainty.

**Method:** We propose CLoE, a curriculum learning framework for ordinal classification that considers label reliability and the ordinal nature of the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES). It uses an estimated image quality metric, derived from BBPS labels, to order training samples from easy to hard, combined with ResizeMix augmentation.

**Result:** The CLoE method improves performance over traditional supervised and self-supervised methods on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets with both CNNs and Transformers, achieving high accuracy and QWK with minimal computational cost.

**Conclusion:** The study highlights the value of CLoE in addressing the challenges of ordinal classification under label uncertainty, demonstrating improved robustness and accuracy across different datasets and architectures.

**Abstract:** Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的步态识别任务面临的挑战包括缺乏大规模标注的数据集和个体多样化步态样本收集的困难，特别是在保护隐私的前提下。

**Method:** GaitCrafter 使用从头开始训练的视频扩散模型，专门针对步态轮廓数据，生成连贯和保持身份的步态序列，同时该过程具有可控性，可以根据诸如服装、携带物品和视角等变量进行调节。

**Result:** 在步态识别管道中加入由 GaitCrafter 生成的人工样本，能够提高性能表现，特别是在具有挑战性的条件下。

**Conclusion:** 这项工作向着利用扩散模型进行高品质、可控且具有隐私意识的步态数据生成迈出了重要的一步。

**Abstract:** Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

> Prune2Drive is proposed to efficiently prune visual tokens in Vision-Language Models for autonomous driving, leading to faster and more memory-efficient inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To reduce the computational overhead caused by high-resolution, multi-view images in Vision-Language Models in autonomous driving systems.

**Method:** Prune2Drive, a visual token pruning framework that includes a diversity-aware token selection mechanism and a view-adaptive pruning controller.

**Result:** Significant speedups and memory savings with maintained or improved task performance on DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1 benchmarks.

**Conclusion:** Prune2Drive effectively addresses computational challenges without requiring model retraining, making it a versatile enhancement for Vision-Language Models in autonomous driving.

**Abstract:** Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 虽然很多方法提出用于在严格Lp范数约束下的白盒设置生成对抗样本，但它们通常不能很好地与人类感知保持一致。本文探索了如何将Lp约束攻击的观点应用到提高对抗样本的感知效果上。

**Method:** Structure

**Result:** DAASH在CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, 和ImageNet数据集上的对抗训练模型上进行了评估，显示出显著优于之前最先进的感知攻击，取得了更高的攻击成功率和更优的视觉质量。

**Conclusion:** DAASH是一个能够集成不同Lp约束攻击方法的多阶段元攻击框架，并通过一个新颖的元损失函数引导过程，实现攻击成功的同时最小化感知失真。此方法优于当前大多数基于感知优化的方法，可在对抗训练模型上提供一个强大的基准测试。

**Abstract:** Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

**Method:** 本文提出了一种可扩展且易于解释的计算机视觉框架，用于通过正面照片量化面部整形手术的美学效果。该框架利用了自动标记点检测、几何面部对称性计算、基于深度学习的年龄估计以及鼻形态分析。

**Result:** 作者们构建了迄今最大的前置和后置面部图像配对数据集，包括1,259名患者共7,160张照片。其中，专门针对鼻整形手术的数据集有366名患者共732张照片，绝大多数患者在三个鼻部测量值中至少有一个显著改善。在更广泛的正面视角组中，包含989个严格筛选的个体，71.3%的个体在全球面部对称性或感知年龄方面有显著改进。在术后，患者身份保持一致，假阳性率为0.01%时，总体匹配率分别为99.5%和99.6%。

**Conclusion:** 作者们认为他们的框架为基于数据的外科手术规划、病人咨询提供了可重复、定量的标准，并且能够进行客观的结果评估。

**Abstract:** We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

**Motivation:** 发现视觉与语言模型在多个多选题视觉问答基准上存在仅利用视觉和选项、而无需问题即可正确作答的偏差。

**Method:** 通过GroundAttack工具自动生成在视觉上与正确答案相似的负选项，以消除Easy-Options Bias。

**Result:** 应用到NExT-QA和MMStar数据集后，修复Easy-Options Bias的验证集使现有视觉-语言模型在仅使用视觉和选项的情况下准确率接近随机水平，并在视觉、问题、选项情况下下降。

**Conclusion:** GroundAttack工具能够有效生成难负选项，提供更准确的视觉-语言模型问答能力评估。

**Abstract:** In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

**Abstract:** Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

**Method:** 论文提出了EDTalk++框架，使用四个轻量级模块将面部动态分解为四个独立的潜在空间，分别表示口型、姿势、眼睛和表情，并通过正交约束保证独立性，通过有效的训练策略实现动作责任分配。

**Result:** 作者通过实验展示了EDTalk++的有效性。

**Conclusion:** 该框架能够实现面部多个动作的独立控制，并可以接收视频或音频输入，扩展了讲头生成的应用场景。

**Abstract:** Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

**Method:** 本研究比較了 Vision Transformers (ViTs) 和基于卷积神经网络 (CNN) 的模型在从内窥镜图像分类肾结石任务中的表现，主要使用了两个离体数据集，包括 CCD 相机和灵活输尿管镜图像。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，在 ImageNet-21k 上预训练的 ViT-base 模型在多个成像条件下始终优于 ResNet50。例如，在最具视觉复杂的子集（内窥镜图像的局部切片）中，ViT 模型的精确度达到了 95.2%，F1 分数为 95.1%，而 ResNet50 分别为 64.5% 和 59.3%。在来自 CCD 相机图像混合视图子集中，ViT 的精确度达到 87.1%，相比之下，CNN 的精确度为 78.4%。这些改进也延伸到了准确率和召回率。

**Conclusion:** 结果表明基于 Vision Transformers 的架构在肾结石图像分类任务中提供了优越的分类性能，可能是传统 CNNs 的一个可扩展替代方案。

**Abstract:** Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决使用单独的神经网络为每个图像编码时在计算和存储效率上的问题。

**Method:** MINR 分享特定层以高效编码多张图像，同时为每张图像设计了一个新的投影层以捕获其独特特征。

**Result:** 实验结果显示MINR可以在节省参数（高达60%）的同时保持相似的性能，并且可以有效地处理100张图像，同时保持平均峰值信噪比（PSNR）为34 dB。

**Conclusion:** MINR有效减少参数并保持图像重建和超分辨率任务的表现，显示了其对于多种主干结构的鲁棒性。

**Abstract:** Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管INR表现优异，但需要使用全精度数表示进行准确计算，导致显著的硬件开销。之前的量化解法主要集中在权重量化，缺乏激活量化，硬件节约有限。

**Method:** DHQ, 一种基于Hadamard变换的分布感知量化方案，用于对INR中的权重和激活函数进行量化，通过Hadamard变换将不同的分布统一为钟形分布后再应用标准量化器。

**Result:** 实验结果显示DHQ在各种图像重建任务中优于之前的量化方法，相比全精度方法降低了32.7%的延迟，减少了40.1%的能耗和高达98.3%的资源利用率。

**Conclusion:** DHQ方案可以有效地提升硬件效率，降低INR模型的计算成本。

**Abstract:** Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

**Motivation:** 我们首次研究了INRs（隐式神经表示）的鲁棒性，发现即使是轻微的权重扰动也会导致信号重建质量显著下降，妨碍了这些网络在实际应用中的部署。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种新颖的鲁棒损失函数来规范重建损失相对于权重的梯度，从而提高INRs（隐式神经表示）的鲁棒性。通过最小化带扰动和不带扰动的权重之间的损失差异，增强了在受到细微扰动时的性能稳定性。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，通过最小化损失的扰动影响并引入新的鲁棒性优化方法，可以显著提升在不同条件下隐式神经表示的质量。

**Abstract:** Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

**Conclusion:** 基于多任务学习和层次注意力机制的新微表情识别方法FAMNet，通过结合2D和3D卷积网络有效地提取了微表情的全方向特征，显著提高了在多个数据集上的任务性能。

**Abstract:** Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

**Conclusion:** 综合实验验证，CORENet相比现有的主流方法具有更优性能。

**Abstract:** 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper aims to address the issue of overlooked cluster-oriented representation learning in multi-view clustering, proposing a novel framework to improve inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness by utilizing the consistency and complementarity between multi-view features.

**Method:** The BDCL framework introduces three key modules: 1) Multi-view instance learning, which aligns consistent information while preserving private features through a combination of reconstruction autoencoders and contrastive learning. 2) Bi-level decoupling of features and clusters, aimed at enhancing the discriminability of both the feature and cluster spaces. 3) Consistency learning module, which treats different views of samples and their neighbors as positive pairs, focusing on learning consistent clustering assignments and compressing the intra-cluster space.

**Result:** Experiments on five benchmark datasets show that the proposed BDCL method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its superiority in multi-view clustering tasks.

**Conclusion:** The proposed BDCL method effectively enhances the inter-cluster discriminability and intra-cluster compactness of multi-view data, validated through superior experimental results on benchmark datasets compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 主流的高动态范围成像技术通常依赖于融合不同曝光设置（快门速度和ISO）拍摄的多张图像。快门速度和ISO之间良好的平衡对于实现高质量的HDR至关重要。然而，现有方法往往忽视了快门速度和ISO之间复杂的相互作用，并且无法考虑动态场景中的运动模糊效应。

**Method:** 提出了一种基于强化学习的方法AdaptiveAE，该方法优化了快门速度和ISO组合的选择，以在动态环境中最大化HDR重建质量。AdaptiveAE结合了一个将运动模糊和噪声模拟纳入训练过程的图像合成管道，利用语义信息和曝光直方图。

**Result:** 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，AdaptiveAE达到了最先进的性能。

**Conclusion:** AdaptiveAE能够自适应地选择最佳的ISO和快门速度序列，基于用户定义的曝光时间预算，并且其找到的曝光调度优于传统解决方案。

**Abstract:** Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

**Motivation:** 尽管双打比赛在国际赛事中比单打更为普遍，但是由于数据可用性和多人跟踪的挑战，之前的大多数研究都主要集中于单打。因此，我们的研究旨在填补这一空白。

**Method:** 我们设计了一种将单打训练模型转移到双打分析的方法。我们使用ViT-Pose从ShuttleSet单打数据集中提取关键点，并通过基于ST-GCN的对比学习框架进行嵌入。为了提高跟踪稳定性，我们结合了一个自定义的多目标跟踪算法来解决快速和重叠的运动员移动造成的ID切换问题。最后，一个基于Transformer的分类器根据学习到的嵌入确定击球发生。

**Conclusion:** 基于姿势的双打击球识别是可行的，并为此类活动提供了巨大的分析潜力。我们的方法为未来研究建立了一个基础，将促进双打数据分析的发展。

**Abstract:** Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的基于量化的方法在建模结构化的视觉信息时表现不佳，因为它们缺乏对几何结构的建模能力。

**Method:** 引入了Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ)，将图像潜在表示为2D高斯分布，以直接编码结构相关的参数，如位置、旋转和比例，从而提高结构化视觉信息的建模能力。

**Result:** 在ImageNet上进行实验显示，VGQ在增加2D高斯密度的同时实现了更高的重建保真度，rFID评分低至0.556，PSNR达到24.93，超过了现有的方法。

**Conclusion:** 通过整合2D高斯分布，VGQ能够有效建模几何和空间结构，显著提高了重建质量和视觉效果。

**Abstract:** The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

**Abstract:** Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and

> 研究对比了开源视觉语言模型（如Phi-3.5 Vision和CLIP）和传统深度学习模型（如VGG19、ResNet-50和EfficientNet-B0）在FER-2013数据集上的面部表情识别能力，结果表明传统模型显著优于视觉语言模型，并强调了适应嘈杂环境改进视觉语言模型的需求。

<details>

**Motivation:** 鉴于面部表情识别在人机交互和心理健康诊断中的重要性，研究旨在比较和评估不同模型在面部表情识别任务上的表现，特别是解决现有视觉语言模型面对Fer-2013数据集带来的挑战。

**Method:** 研究提出了一个集成了GFPGAN图像修复与FER评估的管道，并在FER-2013数据集上比较了开源视觉语言模型和传统模型的性能。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，EfficientNet-B0和ResNet-50两种传统模型分别以86.44%和85.72%的准确率显著优于视觉语言模型CLIP和Phi-3.5 Vision。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果揭示了视觉语言模型在低质量视觉任务上的局限性，并提供了一个可重复的基准测试，为未来的研究提供了有价值的参考。

**Abstract:** Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

*Shikun Zhang,Cunjian Chen,Yiqun Wang,Qiuhong Ke,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

> A new 3DGS-based framework called EAvatar is introduced to improve high-fidelity head avatar reconstructions by accurately capturing facial expressions and preserving local textures using a sparse deformation control mechanism and high-quality 3D priors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to mitigate the limitations of existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and preserving local texture continuity, particularly in highly deformable regions.

**Method:** Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of their neighboring Gaussians, and we leverage high-quality 3D priors from pretrained generative models to provide structural guidance.

**Result:** Experimental results show improved expression and detail fidelity in head reconstructions compared to existing methods.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that the proposed EAvatar 3DGS-based framework achieves more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

**Abstract:** High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

> 提出FLAIR方法改进隐式神经表示，通过RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE提升频谱选择性和空间定位能力，实现2D图像表示、恢复和3D重建的性能提升。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有隐式神经表示缺乏频率选择性、空间定位和稀疏表示，导致过度依赖冗余信号成分，倾向于学习低频成分并难以捕捉细小高频细节。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为FLAIR（频谱和局部感知隐式神经表征）的方法，该方法包括两个关键创新：RC-GAUSS激活函数和Wavelet-Energy-Guided编码（WEGE）。RC-GAUSS激活函数能够在时频不确定性原理的约束下进行频率选择和空间定位。WEGE则利用离散小波变换计算能量分数，指导频谱信息输入网络。

**Result:** 该方法在2D图像表示和恢复以及3D重建方面始终优于现有的隐式神经表示方法。

**Conclusion:** 通过引入频率选择性和空间定位的改进，FLAIR成功解决了现有隐式神经表示的局限，并在多个视觉任务中展现了优越性能。

**Abstract:** Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind GazeProphet is to reduce the computational costs of foveated rendering in VR by eliminating the need for expensive eye tracking hardware. It aims to make foveated rendering more accessible to a wide range of VR platforms and applications.

**Method:** The paper introduces GazeProphet, a software-only method for gaze prediction in VR environments, combining a Spherical Vision Transformer for spatial scene processing with an LSTM-based temporal encoder for gaze sequence pattern recognition. A multi-modal fusion network integrates spatial and temporal features to predict future gaze locations with confidence estimates.

**Result:** GazeProphet achieves a median angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming saliency-based methods by 24%. It shows consistency across all spatial regions and scene types with reliable confidence calibration. Statistical analysis verifies the improvements in all evaluation metrics.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion highlights the success of GazeProphet in achieving accurate gaze prediction without the need for specialized hardware, thus broadening the applicability of foveated rendering across various VR environments.

**Abstract:** Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

> 研究了多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）准确识别输入图像旋转角度（0°, 90°, 180°, 270°）的能力。尽管任务很简单，但许多先进的MLLMs并不能可靠地识别旋转图像。即使提供额外信息或使用chain-of-thought提示，效果改进也不明显。结果显示MLLMs在识别0°和180°图像方面表现更好，但在区分90°和270°旋转时存在显著差距。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 评估MLLMs在检测输入图像旋转角度方面的能力，揭示其视觉推理能力和空间感知能力与人类感知之间的差距。

**Method:** 创建了RotBench基准数据集，包含350张手动筛选的生活方式、肖像和风景图像，以评估不同MLLMs的性能。测试了辅助信息、chain-of-thought提示等方法对模型性能的影响，同时展示了不同角度图像并提供投票机制。

**Result:** 测试显示，尽管一些模型在识别0°和180°图像时表现较好，但无一能够可靠地区分90°和270°旋转。即使经过微调，模型在识别90°和270°旋转方面也没有显著改进。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明当前MLLMs在空间推理能力上存在局限，与人类识别旋转图像的能力存在显著差距。

**Abstract:** We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

> 本文提出了一种轻量级的生成性人脸视频编码方法，通过架构重设计和操作优化来应对计算复杂度问题，并取得了优于现有标准的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 生成性人脸识别（GFVC）通过利用深度生成模型的强推断能力实现了优越的率失真性能，然而它的实际部署因为大模型参数和高昂的计算成本而受到阻碍。本文旨在通过提出一种轻量级的GFVC框架来解决这些问题。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种轻量级的生成性人脸视频编码框架，该框架通过架构重设计和操作优化两种方式来降低计算复杂度。在架构上，用更高效、更薄的层替换了传统的3x3卷积层，以减少复杂度而不损害特征表达性。在操作上，提出了两种阶段的自适应通道剪枝策略，包括训练期间通过学习阈值识别冗余通道的软剪枝和训练后永久移除冗余通道的硬剪枝。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，提出的轻量级双模式优化方法在感知级质量度量方面能够达到比现有视频编码标准Versatile Video Coding (VVC)更优的性能。与基线相比，该方法可以实现参数减少90.4%，计算节省88.9%。

**Conclusion:** 文中所提方法预计可以使生成性人脸视频编码在资源受限的环境下，如移动边缘设备中有效地部署。

**Abstract:** Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 促进脉冲神经网络（SNNs）的发展，解决SNNs性能不如传统深度学习模型的问题，尤其是在保持突触计算的研究初衷方面。

**Method:** 提出了一种类似神经元的编码方法，该方法基于生物神经元的内在操作原则和功能生成基于脉冲的数据。同时，通过引入人工视网膜层，使脉冲数据携带颜色和亮度信息，形成完整的视觉脉冲信号。

**Result:** 基于积攒发放（Integrate-and-Fire）神经元模型的实验结果表明，这种方法增加了脉冲信号中的信息量，并改善了SNNs的性能。

**Conclusion:** 这种方法符合神经形态计算的原则，具有在神经形态计算领域进一步发展的潜力，并可能有助于克服当前该领域的局限性，为SNNs的广泛应用奠定基础。

**Abstract:** In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 近期的视觉-语言模型显示了对未见类别的类泛化能力，但其跨类泛化主要依赖于现实中的已见异常样本的先验知识。本研究旨在提出一种新框架，能够在未见的对象类别中检测视觉异常，而无需针对目标数据进行再训练。

**Method:** DictAS框架，该框架利用少量正常参考图像作为视觉提示，使统一模型能够在没有针对目标数据的再训练情况下检测未知类别中的视觉异常。DictAS主要由三个组件组成：1）字典构建，使用正常参考图像的特征来模拟字典的索引和内容；2）字典查找，通过稀疏查找策略检索查询区域特征。无法检索到的查询特征被视为异常；3）查询区分度正则化，通过提出对比查询约束和文本对齐约束来增强异常区分度。

**Result:** DictAS在七个公共的工业和医疗数据集上进行的广泛实验中表现优于现有的FSAS方法。

**Conclusion:** DictAS通过模拟现实字典的索引和内容、稀疏查找策略和查询区分度正则化，提供了一种有竞争力的方法来解决未见类别的FSAS问题。

**Abstract:** Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the high computational cost of SMPLify, which limits its practicality in 3D human pose and shape estimation, by adopting a data-driven neural network approach that can achieve significant runtime improvements.

**Method:** The paper proposes Learnable SMPLify, a neural framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a single-pass regression model to reduce computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. It introduces a temporal sampling strategy to construct effective training data and a human-centric normalization scheme to improve generalization.

**Result:** The framework achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify, generalizes well to unseen datasets like 3DPW and RICH, and can be used as a plug-in tool with other image-based estimators like LucidAction.

**Conclusion:** Learnable SMPLify is a practical and simple baseline for 3D human pose and shape estimation that significantly reduces the computational cost while maintaining accuracy, making it a valuable tool in the field of inverse kinematics research.

**Abstract:** In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

**Motivation:** 现有的方法在特征提取中忽略了特征语义，主要集中在优化动作建议上，这些解决方案对于高精度的物联网应用（如自动驾驶）来说不够健壯和可扩展，因此有必要提出一种新的模型。

**Method:** 我们的模型利用动作前景和背景之间的差异，同时学习时序动作特征语义的帧依赖性和段依赖性，有效地利用了特征语义。

**Conclusion:** 该研究提出了一种新的基于生成注意力的模型，能够更好地学习动作语义特征，从而提高了在智能视频分析中的表现。

**Abstract:** Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

**Motivation:** 观察到近期RVOS方法过于强调特征提取和时间建模，而忽视了分割头部的设计。我们注意到分割头部设计方面仍有较大的改进空间。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种Temporal-Conditional Referring Video Object Segmentation模型，该模型通过整合现有的分割方法来有效提升边界分割能力。同时，本模型使用文本到视频扩散模型进行特征提取，并移除了传统的噪声预测模块，以避免噪声随机性影响分割精度。此外，为了解决VAE特征提取能力有限的问题，设计了一个Temporal Context Mask Refinement (TCMR)模块，该模块显著提高了分割质量，没有引入复杂的结构设计。

**Result:** 所提出的方法在四个公开的RVOS基准测试中始终达到了最先进的性能。

**Conclusion:** 我们的模型方案在简化复杂设计的同时，通过改进分割头的设计和使用Text-to-video扩散模型以及TCMR模块，有效地提升了分割质量和性能。

**Abstract:** Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

**Method:** Our method proposes a novel Domain Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into adverse weather conditions using several data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based, and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse images.

**Result:** The method achieves a 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation and a 4.62 percent improvement specifically on nighttime conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method for AD systems in challenging environments.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion emphasizes the efficacy of the hybrid method for robust AD perception under challenging conditions, indicating that synthetic data augmentation can enhance the performance of AD systems in adverse weather conditions.

**Abstract:** Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

> 论文开发了一种名为MaMe的令牌合并策略，专门用于改进SSM的计算效率与性能，特别是在保持顺序信息完整性的同时减少令牌数量。该方法在图像分类及视频、音频等领域都发挥出色效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管状态空间模型（SSMs）在计算机视觉中显示出强大的架构能力，但提高它们的计算效率对于实际和可扩展的部署仍然至关重要。令牌减少作为一种有效的方法来提高模型效率，但在应用于SSMs时需要对其独特的顺序建模能力进行仔细考虑。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为MaMe的分组合并策略，该策略专门针对基于状态空间模型的视觉模型。MaMe解决了两个关键挑战：量化令牌的重要性以及保持顺序属性。该方法利用状态转换参数$\mathbf{\Delta}$作为信息量度，并引入了战略性令牌排列以保持顺序信息流。

**Result:** 广泛的实验表明，MaMe在细调和现成模型中都能实现优越的效率-性能权衡。特别是，即使在激进的令牌减少情况下，MaMe也保持了鲁棒性，而其他方法则出现了显著的性能退化。

**Conclusion:** MaMe方法不仅在图像分类中表现出色，在视频和音频领域也展示了强大的泛化能力，为提高各种SSM应用的效率提供了一种有效途径。

**Abstract:** State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

> FoundationSSC proposes a decoupling framework for improved 3D semantic scene completion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on relevant benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance of 3D semantic scene completion by decoupling the semantic and geometric pathways and sources, avoiding the trade-offs of existing coupled models.

**Method:** FoundationSSC introduces a foundation encoder and Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module, utilizing dual-decoupling at source and pathway levels to refine semantic context and depth distributions.

**Result:** FoundationSSC surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving +0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI and state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360.

**Conclusion:** The decoupling strategy in FoundationSSC leads to improved semantic and geometric performance in 3D scene completion, setting new benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

**Conclusion:** The PersonaVlog framework, with its multimodal collaboration and feedback mechanisms, shows great potential for generating personalized and high-quality Vlogs efficiently and creatively.

**Abstract:** With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

**Abstract:** Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for

**Motivation:** 现有模型在处理人类多样性（种族、语言、年龄组）方面存在泛化缺口，这是由于现有训练数据的局限性所导致的，数据缺乏规模、质量和多样性。本文通过创建新的数据集TalkVid和评估集TalkVid-Bench来解决这个问题。

**Method:** 通过引入TalkVid，一个大规模、高质量且多样化的数据集，该数据集含有1244小时来自7729个独特发言者的视频，以解决现有训练数据规模、质量和多样性所带来的泛化差距问题。TalkVid是通过一个严格的、多阶段自动化流水线创建的，并通过人类判断来验证其可靠性。此外，还构建并发布了TalkVid-Bench，这是一个含有500个剪辑，精心平衡了关键人口统计和语言轴的分层评估集。

**Conclusion:** 本文揭示了通过传统的聚合指标无法显现的亚群组性能差异，强调了TalkVid-Bench在未来研究中的重要性。

**Abstract:** Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 该研究旨在克服现有RGB-D类别级物体姿态估计方法在缺乏深度信息场景中的性能挑战，通过仅依赖RGB图像实现真实场景中的准确姿态估计。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种基于RGB图像的类别级物体姿态估计方法，该方法设计了一种基于Transformer的神经网络，用于预测和融合目标物体的几何特征，并引入了一种几何特征引导算法以增强网络对物体几何信息的有效表示。在姿态计算阶段采用了RANSAC-PnP算法来解决尺度变化的问题。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，该方法在基准数据集上不仅高效，而且与之前基于RGB的方法相比，准确度更高。

**Conclusion:** 该研究提供了一种在没有深度数据的情况下，实现类别级物体姿态估计的新视角，证明了使用RGB图像进行姿态估计的有效性和优越性。

**Abstract:** While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

**Motivation:** 识别了条件生成中的'训练-推理差距'，该差距影响生成性能，并使得输出对指导权重高度敏感。

**Method:** DiffIER,一种基于优化的方法，用于高质量生成。通过在推理阶段的每一步进行迭代误差最小化来有效减少累积误差。

**Result:** 通过引入这种新颖的即插即用优化框架，优化每一步推理过程中的错误，提高了生成质量。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果显示，该方法在条件生成任务中优于基线方法，并在文本到图像生成、图像超分辨率和文本到语音生成中表现出一致的成功，展示了其广泛的应用潜力。

**Abstract:** Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

**Abstract:** Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

> DeH4R is a new hybrid model for road network extraction from remote sensing data that outperforms previous methods by improving inference speed, topology fidelity, and spatial consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To tackle the difficulty in automatically extracting full and exact road network graphs from satellite imagery and addressing limitations of segmentation-based and graph-growing approaches.

**Method:** Graph-generating and graph-growing methods are combined in DeH4R. It separates the task into four parts: candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex prediction, initial graph construction, and graph expansion. This design allows for dynamic vertex/edge insertions while keeping quick inference and improving topology fidelity and spatial consistency.

**Result:** DeH4R demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks, outperforming the previous SOTA graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while being approximately 10 times faster.

**Conclusion:** DeH4R, as a hybrid model that integrates the efficiency of graph generation and the dynamics of graph growth, shows improved performance with faster inference speed and better topology fidelity and spatial consistency for extracting road networks from remote sensing imagery.

**Abstract:** The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly

**Abstract:** The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

**Method:** 提出了名为DCMamba的框架，通过开发补丁级的弱强混合增强技术、引入基于不同扫描方向预测差异的多样化扫描合作模块以及采用不确定性加权对比学习机制从数据、网络和特征层面来增强多样性。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，DCMamba在半监督医学图像分割上显著优于其他方法，尤其是在Synapse数据集上，当只有20%的数据被标记时，其性能比最新的SSM方法高出6.69%。

**Conclusion:** DCMamba框架通过多样性的引入，在半监督医学图像分割上表现出了显著的优势。

**Abstract:** Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the challenge of finding relevant Metaverse scenarios that match users' interests, especially in educational content related to agriculture and gardening, by leveraging both the visual and textual features of the content.

**Method:** The paper introduces a hierarchical vision-language model designed to represent and retrieve content from a newly created dataset of 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), enriched with textual descriptions.

**Result:** The model achieves a retrieval accuracy (R@1) of about 62%, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 78%. It also shows an improvement of up to 6% R@1 and 11% MRR on existing benchmarks.

**Conclusion:** The research demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical vision-language model in representing and retrieving relevant AgriMuseums from a large dataset using natural language queries.

**Abstract:** Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

### [88] [Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models through Intermediate Projector Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739)
*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

> 提出了一种新的对抗攻击方法IPGA，其利用视觉语言模型中的中间投影模块来实现更精确的视觉操控，并展示了该方法在多个任务上的优越性和跨模型的可迁移性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的对抗攻击方法在视觉语言模型中的操纵精确度较低，忽略了投影模块对攻击效果的关键作用，因此提出了新的方法以改善这一情况。

**Method:** 提出Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA)，使用Q-Former将全局图像嵌入转换为细粒度的视觉特征，并引入Residual Query Alignment (RQA)来保护无关的视觉内容。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，IPGA在标准的全局图像描述和细粒度的视觉问答任务中表现优于现有方法，且能够在黑盒环境中以及多个商用视觉语言模型上成功迁移。

**Conclusion:** IPGA方法提供了更精确地控制对抗攻击的手段，并且能够有效地跨模型进行迁移，证明了其在视觉语言模型安全性测试中的潜力。

**Abstract:** Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Main category: cs.CV

> 论文提出了一种名为FOCUS的技术，来解决大型视觉-语言模型在处理多图像任务时遇到的跨图像信息泄露问题。FOCUS是一种无需训练且架构无关的策略，通过部分遮挡图像并对比精炼处理，提升了多图像任务的准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）在单图像任务上表现出色，但面对多图像输入时，性能显著下降。这种性能下降的原因在于不同图像的视觉线索在模型的输出中交织在一起，形成了作者所谓的跨图像信息泄露。

**Method:** 为了解决跨图像信息泄露的问题，作者提出了一种无需训练且架构无关的解码策略FOCUS。该策略在推理过程中，通过依次遮挡除一个图像外的所有图像，引导模型专注于单个清晰图像。重复该过程以获取部分遮挡上下文下的logits。最后通过对比性精炼操作，使用纯噪点的参考输入抑制信息泄露，获得更准确的输出。

**Result:** 跨四个多图像基准和多种LVLM家族进行的实验表明，FOCUS可以一致地提升这些模型在多图像任务上的性能。

**Conclusion:** FOCUS是一种通用且实用的解决方案，能够增强大型视觉-语言模型在多图像推理任务上的表现，且不需要额外的训练或架构修改。

**Abstract:** Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的6D姿态估计数据集主要集中在小型家用物品上，对移动机器人来说不够贴合实际。移动平台通常没有操作臂，处理较大的物体，并面临着长距离感知、严重的自我遮挡和多种相机视角的挑战。

**Method:** 该数据集MR6D专为工业环境中的移动机器人6D姿态估计算法设计，包含了92个现实场景和16种独特的物体，涵盖了静态和动态交互情况。MR6D旨在捕捉移动平台特有的挑战，包括远距离视角、多样的物体配置、较大的物体尺寸以及复杂的遮挡/自遮挡模式。

**Result:** 初步实验表明，当前的6D管道在这种设置下表现不佳，2D分割同样是一个障碍。

**Conclusion:** 通过提出MR6D数据集，为开发和评估移动机器人特有的姿态估计方法奠定了基础。

**Abstract:** Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

**Method:** 文章提出了一种新的方法，用于将3D形状与多个摄像机观察到的2D关键点进行非刚性配准。该方法适用于任意变形物体，并提出了三种解决方案：一种是从已知3D点出发的关键点对应方向向量，一种是从未知3D点出发但方向已知的关键点对应方向向量，以及一种结合关键点和物体轮廓的方法。方法的求解过程包含了凸优化和迭代优化。

**Result:** 实验表明，在合成数据和实际数据上，该方法能够提高重建的准确性。

**Conclusion:** 本研究是首次使用广义摄像机模型解决形状配准问题，通过利用多个视图的互约束，提高了配准结果的准确性。

**Abstract:** This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

Main category: cs.CV

> 提出VisionLaw框架，旨在通过LLM生成与修订构成定律，并利用视觉模拟评估其一致性，从而从视觉观测中推断出3D物体的内在动力学。实验表明，该方法在真实与合成数据集中均表现出优越的性能和良好的泛化能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的推断物理对象内在动力学的方法面临两个主要挑战：一种依赖人工定义的构成先验，这使推广到复杂情况变得困难；另一种使用神经网络建模内在动力学，这导致解读性差和泛化能力差。为了应对这些挑战，提出了VisionLaw。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为VisionLaw的双层优化框架，用于从视觉观测中推断出内在动力学的可解释表达。上层采用LLMs驱动的解耦构成演化策略，其中LLMs扮演物理专家角色，生成并修订构成定律，并通过内置解耦机制大幅降低搜索复杂度。下层引入视觉引导的构成评估机制，利用视觉模拟评估生成的构成定律与底层内在动力学的一致性，以指导上层演化。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，VisionLaw能有效地从视觉观测中推断出内在动力学，明显优于现有的最先进的方法，并在新颖场景的交互模拟中表现出强大的泛化能力。

**Conclusion:** VisionLaw框架成功解决了现有方法中的解读性和泛化性问题，能够有效地推断3D对象的内在动力学，推进了视觉模拟领域的发展。

**Abstract:** The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

> Med-CTX is a transformer-based framework that leverages biomedical language and visual data to accurately segment breast cancer ultrasounds, providing not just segmentation but also uncertainties and explanatory information, outperforming previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the performance and interpretability of breast cancer ultrasound segmentation, we designed a framework that integrates multimodal data, especially clinical reports, to provide improved segmentation and clinically grounded explanations.

**Method:** We introduce Med-CTX, which integrates clinical radiology reports with a dual-branch visual encoder combining ViT and Swin transformers. BioClinicalBERT encodes clinical reports enhanced with BI-RADS semantics and combines with visual features using cross-modal attention. This results in segmentation masks, uncertainty maps, and diagnostic rationales.

**Result:** On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, significantly outperforming U-Net, ViT, and Swin. Ablation studies confirm the importance of clinical text, showing a -5.4% decrease in Dice score and a -31% drop in explanation quality (CIDEr).

**Conclusion:** Med-CTX demonstrates superior performance and interpretability for breast cancer ultrasound segmentation, setting a new standard for trustworthy multimodal medical architectures with good multimodal alignment and improved confidence calibration.

**Abstract:** We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

### [94] [Timestep-Compressed Attack on Spiking Neural Networks through Timestep-Level Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13812)
*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Hyeongboo Baek,Brent ByungHoon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

> This paper presents a Timestep-Compressed Attack (TCA) framework that significantly reduces attack latency on spiking neural networks (SNNs) by implementing Timestep-Level Backpropagation (TLBP) and Adversarial Membrane Potential Reuse (A-MPR), achieving a latency reduction of up to 57.1% while maintaining a comparable attack success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind the TCA is to address the inefficiency in state-of-the-art gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural networks (SNNs), particularly the substantial attack latency due to the multi-timestep processing limitation, making the attacks impractical for real-time applications.

**Method:** The paper introduces Timestep-Compressed Attack (TCA), incorporating two components: Timestep-Level Backpropagation (TLBP) and Adversarial Membrane Potential Reuse (A-MPR). TLBP enables per-timestep evaluation by removing the critical role of global temporal information, and A-MPR pre-calculates and reuses the initial membrane potential to avoid inefficient warm-up phases.

**Result:** Experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets demonstrated that TCA reduces attack latency significantly, up to 56.6% and 57.1% in white-box and black-box settings, respectively, without greatly affecting attack success rates.

**Conclusion:** This paper concludes that by optimizing spiking neural network architectures for adversarial attacks with TCA, it is possible to drastically reduce the time required for such attacks, thereby facilitating real-time applications without compromising the effectiveness of the attack.

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

**Motivation:** 城市树木生物多样性对于气候恢复力、生态稳定性和城市宜居性至关重要，但大部分市政府缺乏对其树冠的详细知识。实地调查虽然可以提供可靠的Shannon和Simpson多样性指数估计，但成本高昂且耗时。另一方面，监督AI方法需要标注数据，这些数据往往难以在不同地区间泛化。因此，我们需要一个不需要标签的更普适的方法来估计城市树木的多样性。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种无监督聚类框架，该框架将街景图像的视觉嵌入与空间种植模式相结合，以在没有标签的情况下估计生物多样性。

**Result:** 应用到北美的八个城市，该方法在属级多样性模式恢复方面具有高精度，对Shannon和Simpson指数的估算与真实值之间的Wasserstein距离较低，同时保持了空间自相关性。

**Conclusion:** 这个可扩展的方法能够在缺乏详细信息的地区进行生物多样性的映射，提供了一种低成本持续监测的巨大可能性，支持了绿地的平等获取，并适用于城市生态系统的适应性管理。

**Abstract:** Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

**Motivation:** 智能交通检测领域的跨域检测仍存在许多挑战，需要解决这些问题来实现顶级性能。

**Method:** 本文提出了自感知自适应对齐（SA3）方法，利用高效对齐机制和识别策略。该方法使用基于注意力的对齐模块，对源域和目标域的数据集进行训练，引导图像级特征对齐过程，实现源域和目标域之间的局部-全局自适应对齐。同时，通过重新加权通道重要性，将来自两个域的特征输入区域提名网络，有助于获取显著区域特征。此外，针对目标域，提出一个实例到图像级别的对齐模块，自适应地减少领域差异。

**Result:** 在流行的跨域目标检测基准测试中进行了广泛实验，结果表明SA3方法优于先前的最先进方法。

**Conclusion:** 通过这些实验，表明了SA3方法在跨域检测中的有效性，能够适应不同领域间的特征对齐，提高检测性能。

**Abstract:** Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

**Method:** 该方法在去噪过程中显式建模信号分量，增强了对生成图像的细粒度控制，减少了过拟合和分布外的伪影。这种方法是无训练的，并且可以无缝集成到现有的扩散模型和流匹配架构中。

**Conclusion:** 新方法生成的图像更忠实于对应的提示，提供了一种有效的方法来改进文本转图像模型的性能。

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的增量学习评估通常依赖于合成的、简化的基准测试，这会掩盖实际增量学习性能。为了弥补这一缺陷，本文设计了两个新的基准测试，旨在捕捉现有评估中所忽略的挑战。

**Method:** 本研究提出了两个现实增量对象检测基准（RICO），包括领域RICO（D-RICO）和扩展类别RICO（EC-RICO），以此来改善增量学习研究中的基准测试。这些基准测试基于14个不同的数据集构建，涵盖了真实的和合成的领域，不同条件如天气、一天中的时间、相机传感器、视角和标注政策下频繁变化的数据，以此反映现有评估中缺失的挑战。

**Result:** 实验结果表明所有的增量学习方法在适应能力和知识保留上表现不佳，而通过回放少量先前数据的表现优于所有方法。然而，单独在数据上进行训练仍然表现最佳。

**Conclusion:** 本研究发现增量学习方法在面对新的增量数据时，预测性能下降，这主要是由于在蒸馏中的弱教师、单模型难以处理多样任务、以及适应力不足导致。

**Abstract:** Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

**Result:** LCRReg 在控制玩具数据集上大幅提升其对注入的非目标相关性的鲁棒性，在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中也表现出在合成的非目标扰动和分布外泛化上的性能提升。

**Conclusion:** LCRReg 是一种轻量级的模型鲁棒性提升策略，不依赖密集的概念监督，并且对架构无偏性。其优势体现在提效模型对于概念的准确捕捉与泛化能力上。

**Abstract:** Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 南亚烟雾是指每年11月至2月期间影响印度河-恒河平原的一种高频发生、污染严重并具有显著社会经济影响的空气污染事件。尽管该地区已知有大量的空气污染来源，但现阶段仍缺少区域性的实时预报系统。

**Method:** 使用Sentinel-5P大气成分数据（2019-2023）和卷积长短时记忆（ConvLSTM）神经网络预测气溶胶事件。此模型能够比之前的模型更有效地捕捉空间和时间上的关联。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，使用340-380纳米波段的紫外气溶胶指数作为预测变量，模型能够以五天为间隔对未来气溶胶指数进行预测，其均方误差为~0.0018，损失值为~0.3995，结构相似性指数为~0.74。

**Conclusion:** 虽然模型在预测气溶胶事件方面表现出色，但通过集成额外的数据源和进一步优化模型架构，还可以进一步改进模型的性能。

**Abstract:** The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的方法忽视了长程依赖关系，而基于Transformer的方法则可能忽略局部上下文信息。因此，本文通过提出新的模块和框架来弥补这些缺陷。

**Method:** 我们提出了一个新的特征聚合模块（FAM），它结合了卷积操作和交叉注意力机制，旨在处理两个来自前一层的特征输入，并将它们分别分配到卷积和交叉注意力并行模块（CCAPM）的两个分支中，以同时关注长程依赖和局部上下文信息。此外，通过在空间通道调节模块（SCRM）中整合FAM，增强了区分显着区域和重要特征的能力。通过将SCRM集成到UNet架构的编码器块中，我们提出了一种新的框架 - 空间通道调节网络（SCRNet）。

**Result:** 通过实验验证，提出的方法在医学超声图像分割中的表现优于现有方法，达到了当前最佳水平。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明，通过结合特征聚合模块（FAM）和空间通道调节模块（SCRM）在UNet中的应用，提出的SCRNet网络在医学超声图像分割任务中达到了当前最佳性能。

**Abstract:** Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the limitation of existing methods that focus on a single type of illumination degradation and fail to handle diverse lighting conditions effectively.

**Method:** The paper proposes DIME-Net, which consists of a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator with a sparse gating mechanism for adaptive selection of S-curve expert networks, and a damage restoration module with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms.

**Result:** Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets without retraining.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that DIME-Net demonstrates generalization ability and potential for practical applications under diverse illumination conditions.

**Abstract:** Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

> The paper introduces ViT-FIQA, which extends ViT backbones with a new quality token for face image utility prediction, achieving top performance across various face recognition tests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this paper is to explore the potential of Vision Transformer architectures in Face Image Quality Assessment, as current methods are mostly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The authors aim to leverage the strengths of ViTs in handling global contextual information to improve the utility prediction of face images for face recognition systems.

**Method:** This paper proposes ViT-FIQA, a novel method extending standard Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones with a learnable quality token to predict face image utility for face recognition systems. The network uses global self-attention to process the combined sequence of the quality token and image patch tokens. Two output heads are designed: one for learning discriminative face representations and another for predicting the utility of the face image.

**Result:** Extensive experiments on various face recognition benchmarks and models show that ViT-FIQA achieves top-tier performance, indicating the effectiveness of transformer architectures in assessing face image quality and their potential in future research.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that ViT-FIQA, with its unique learnable quality token and dual-head output design, effectively models face image utility, outperforming standard approaches and establishing the potential of Vision Transformers as a scalable foundation for FIQA research.

**Abstract:** Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

**Conclusion:** 通过建立一个新颖的数据集，推动了深度估计研究的发展，并针对现有方法在困难条件下的性能差距提供了新的测试平台。

**Abstract:** Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

**Motivation:** 视频动作检测需要密集的时空注释，这既具有挑战性又昂贵。然而，现实世界中的视频在难度上有所不同，可能不需要相同级别的注释。因此，本文研究了适当的注释类型及其对时空视频动作检测的影响。

**Method:** 通过主动学习策略确定每个视频所需注释类型，并引入新型时空3D超像素方法生成伪标签，以实现有效训练。

**Result:** 与传统方法相比，本文方法显著降低了对精确注释的需求，同时保持了较高的检测精度，降低了注释成本。

**Conclusion:** 该方法通过对UCF101-24和JHMDB-21数据集的验证，证明了能够显著降低注释成本，同时保持了检测性能。

**Abstract:** Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Main category: cs.CV

> This paper addresses the challenge of extending the operational range and safety of autonomous vehicles on intercity highways. It proposes a method that significantly improves object detection and LiDAR forecasting, which are critical for handling long-distance driving and heavy trucks with significant inertia.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this paper is to extend the perception ranges of autonomous vehicles, specifically for scenarios outside urban areas, where the vehicle must operate safely at higher speeds and over longer distances. This addresses the need for improved handling of large vehicles like trucks with significant inertia.

**Method:** Our approach utilizes a sparse representation and introduces an efficient 3D encoding of multi-modal and temporal features. It also employs a novel self-supervised pre-training scheme for large-scale learning from unlabeled camera-LiDAR data.

**Result:** The approach achieves a 26.6% improvement in mAP for object detection and a 30.5% decrease in Chamfer Distance for LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods, extending perception distances up to 250 meters.

**Conclusion:** This paper concludes that by extending the perception range to 250 meters and using a self-supervised pre-training scheme, it is possible to enhance the safety and autonomy of autonomous vehicles, particularly for long-distance driving on intercity highways.

**Abstract:** Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the issue of incomplete 3D scene reconstructions using only keyframes and to develop a generalizable model that incorporates frames from diverse viewpoints under online processing constraints.

**Method:** Our method involves adaptive view selection for improving the completeness of 3DGS models, which selects optimal non-keyframes for additional training based on online reconstruction quality analysis.

**Result:** Experimental results show that our method surpasses existing methods, especially in complex outdoor scenes.

**Conclusion:** The proposed technique effectively increases the completeness of 3DGS models by integrating keyframes and selected non-keyframes from optimal viewpoints, resulting in advanced performance in reconstructions, particularly in challenging outdoor settings.

**Abstract:** This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

**Method:** 提出了一种名为噪声对齐（Noisy Alignment，NA）的数据中毒反对比学习方法，该方法通过操纵对比学习中的随机裁剪机制来抑制中毒图像中的噪声成分，从而更有效地实现反对比学习攻击。这种方法将过程视为一个图像布局优化问题，并通过理论推导得出最优参数。

**Result:** Noisy Alignment方法在保持清洁数据准确性的同时，相较于现有的DPCL方法，取得了最先进的性能。此外，Noisy Alignment还展示了对抗常见背门防御的鲁棒性。

**Conclusion:** 文章提出了一种创新的数据中毒对比学习方法—Noisy Alignment，其能更有效地实现对深度学习模型的针对性攻击，并在保持正常数据准确性的同时，展示了对抗防御的鲁棒性。

**Abstract:** Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

**Abstract:** Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 3DGS已在新视图合成中展现出高效性，但其需要大量的3D高斯分布来实现高质量渲染，这导致较高的内存和存储需求。本文旨在解决这一问题。

**Method:** 该文提出了首个针对3D Gaussian Splatting（3DGS）的知识蒸馏框架。框架包含了多种教师模型，如基础3DGS、噪声增强和dropout正则化版本。引入了一种结构相似性损失函数，以促进学生模型和教师模型之间空间几何分布的一致性。

**Conclusion:** 简单有效的知识蒸馏框架，没有多余的复杂性，在不同数据集上取得了令人满意的渲染结果。

**Abstract:** 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

A new model is developed, integrating visual and textual information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion, which helps in precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.

**Result:** The model achieves state-of-the-art results, notably attaining 71.3% Recall@1 in the visual+text setting and surpassing the current state-of-the-art by 3.4%.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that the proposed dataset, Dense-WebVid-CoVR, and the model, which uses Cross-Attention fusion, significantly improve the precision of aligning dense modifications with target videos, leading to state-of-the-art performance in composed video retrieval.

**Abstract:** Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at
