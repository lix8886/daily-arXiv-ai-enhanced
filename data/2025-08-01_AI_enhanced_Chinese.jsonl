To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise.

This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy).

Existing lane topology\nreasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal\ninformation to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,\nstream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by\nincorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it\nremains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose\nestimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology\nreasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of\npose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision\nof both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual\nreinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce\nlatent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate\nthe state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This\ndesign substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the\nslow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate\nthat FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment\ndetection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%\non OLS).", "AI": {"tldr": "本文提出FASTopoWM框架，通过增强时间信息使用和改进潜在世界模型，在车道段检测和中心线感知方面优于现有方法。", "motivation": "现有的车道拓扑推理方法在有效利用时间信息以提高检测和推理性能方面存在不足。本文旨在通过提出FASTopoWM框架来克服现有方法的局限性。", "method": "本文提出了一种名为FASTopoWM的新颖框架，用于增强车道段拓扑推理。该框架结合了快速和慢速系统，并引入了基于动作潜变量的潜在查询和BEV世界模型，以提高时间感知性能。", "result": "在OpenLane-V2基准测试上，FASTopoWM在车道段检测（mAP 37.4% vs 33.6%）和中心线感知（OLS 46.3% vs 41.5%）方面超过了现有最先进方法。", "conclusion": "研究证明，FASTopoWM框架通过其独特的设计，在减少姿态估计失败的影响和提升时间感知性能方面取得了显著成效，从而在车道检测和中心线感知方面优于现有方法。"}}

This paper identifies and investigates a\ncritical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades\nsignificantly due to resolution variability across clients.

To address this limitation,\nwe introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable\nof dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we\npropose a \"half-physics\" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a\nphysics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent\nSMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and\nobjects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.\nUnlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex\ntraining, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body\nshape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves\nthe fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating\nphysical interactions", "AI": {"tldr": "文章提出了一个将3D人体模型SMPL-X嵌入到能与其环境进行物理交互的目标中的新方法，通过“半物理”机制，实现了控制、真实物理互动和实时应用，而不需要额外的训练过程。", "motivation": "现有的通用3D人模型由于其运动学特性，无法真实地与环境进行物理交互，其结果显示为物体穿透和不现实的物体动力学问题。据此，本文旨在提出一种能够解决这类问题的新方法。", "method": "提出了一种将3D人体模型(SMPL-X)嵌入能够与其环境进行动态物理交互的实体中的新方法。具体地，我们提出了一种“半物理”机制，该机制可以将3D运动学运动转化为物理仿真。这种方法保持了SMPL-X固有的运动学姿态控制，同时确保与场景和物体之间的物理现实交互，有效消除穿透和不现实的物体动力学。", "result": "该方法不仅无需学习，而且能够实时运行，适用于任意体型和动作，保持了原运动学的逼真度，同时无缝地集成了物理互动。", "conclusion": "我们提出的方法有效解决了现有3D人体模型在物理交互方面的问题，实现了更加逼真的物理仿真，且在实时性和泛化能力上表现优秀。"}}

Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of\ncalibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio).

We find that\ndense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view\nsetup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,\nwe carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to\nproduce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions.
