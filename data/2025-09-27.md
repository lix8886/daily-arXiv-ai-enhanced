**Motivation:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

> 研究人员提出了一种新的跨语言语音情感识别框架，该框架通过构建情感特定的说话人社区并在说话人和音素空间中使用双重空间锚定来对齐情感表达，提升了跨语言情感识别的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 跨语言语音情感识别（SER）由于不同语言之间的音素变异性以及说话人特定的情感表达风格差异，仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务。这种多样化的条件要求能够对齐不同说话人和语言的情感表达的框架。

**Method:** 提出了一种基于说话人风格感知的音素锚定框架，该框架在音素和说话人层面上对情感表达进行对齐。该方法通过图聚类构建情感特定的说话人社区以捕捉共享说话人特征。使用这些群组，该框架在说话人和音素空间中应用双重空间锚定，以实现跨语言的情感转移。

**Result:** 在MSP-Podcast（英语）和BIIC-Podcast（台湾普通话）语料库上的评估表明，该方法优于具有竞争力的基线，并为跨语言情感表示的共性提供了有价值的见解。

**Conclusion:** 提出的框架在跨语言情感识别任务中展示了改进的情感传输能力，并为理解不同语言中情感表达的普遍性提供了洞察。

**Abstract:** Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of
complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains
underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past
decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging
testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce
CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components --
CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM
performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver
reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability,
solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes
a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation
of numerical experiments for complex physical systems. Code and data are

### [4] [Assessing Classical Machine Learning and Transformer-based Approaches for Detecting AI-Generated Research Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20375)
*Sharanya Parimanoharan,Ruwan D. Nawarathna*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本研究评估了不同机器学习技术在检测由AI生成的文本方面的表现，并发现DistilBERT在整体表现上最好。这项工作奠定了未来更强大变压器框架的基础，这些框架需要更大、更丰富的数据集，以跟上不断改进的生成AI模型的步伐。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 鉴于大型语言模型如ChatGPT的迅速采用，模糊了人类与AI生成文本之间的界限，这引发了关于学术诚信、知识产权和误传信息传播的紧迫问题。因此，需要一种可靠的人工智能文本检测方法来确保公平评估，保护人类文本的原创性并培养在数字通信中的信任。

**Method:** 研究使用了经典机器学习方法（如逻辑回归结合经典词袋、词性标注和TF-IDF特征）和基于变压器的方法（如BERT结合N-gram、DistilBERT、带有轻量级自定义分类器的BERT和基于LSTM的N-gram模型），测试和比较了这些技术在区分ChatGPT-3.5生成文本和人类书写文本方面的效用。

**Result:** 实验结果显示DistilBERT表现最佳，逻辑回归和Custom-BERT的表现也很稳固、平衡；而LSTM和BERT-N-gram方法表现较差。三项最佳模型的最大投票集成未能超越DistilBERT本身。

**Conclusion:** 此研究为更稳定且适应更大数据集的变压器框架奠定了基础，目标是在发展快速的生成AI模型方面持续取得进展。

**Abstract:** The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

> ConceptViz是一款可视化系统，用于解释大型语言模型（LLMs）中的概念表示，它通过识别、解释和验证步骤，简化了发现和验证有意义的概念表示。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）作为一种有前途的技术用于从大型语言模型（LLMs）中提取可解释特征，但SAE特征本身并不与人类可理解的概念对齐，这使得它们的解释起来复杂且相对繁琐。为了解决这个问题，引入了ConceptViz，旨在填补SAE特征与人类概念之间的空白。


**Method:** ConceptViz采用了一种新颖的识别=>解释=>验证的流程。它允许用户通过概念查询SAEs，使用交互的方式探索概念与SAE特征之间的对齐，并通过模型行为验证算法来验证这些对齐。


**Result:** ConceptViz是一款用于探索大型语言模型（LLMs）中概念的可视化分析系统。通过实现识别=>解释=>验证管道，用户可以使用感兴趣的查询稀疏自动编码器（SAEs），交互探索概念与特征的对齐，并通过模型行为验证来验证对应关系。研究通过两个使用场景和一个用户研究展示了ConceptViz的有效性，结果表明它通过简化发现和验证LLMs中有意义的概念表示，增强了可解释性研究，最终帮助研究人员构建更准确的模型认知。


**Conclusion:** ConceptViz通过改进LLMs中概念发现与验证的流程，提高了可解释性研究的效率，帮助研究人员了解模型内部运作的特点。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at
https://github.com/Happy-Hippo209/ConceptViz.

### [6] [SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20377)
*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

> SKILL-RAG利用模型的自我知识来改善检索内容，通过强化学习框架提高问答生成质量和减少无关文档。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 在近年来，检索增强生成(RAG)显著提高了在知识密集型任务上的大型语言模型(LLMs)的性能。然而，由于检索系统可能会返回无关内容，将这些信息整合到模型中经常会导致幻觉。因此，识别并过滤掉不相关检索内容是提高RAG性能的关键挑战。

**Method:** 我们提出了SKILL-RAG（Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG），这种方法利用模型的自我知识来确定哪些检索到的文档对解答给定查询是有益的。我们设计了一个基于强化学习的训练框架来明确地激发模型的自我知识，并使用句子级别的粒度来过滤掉不相关的内容，同时保留有用的知识。

**Result:** 我们在Llama2-7B和Qwen3-8B上使用多个问答基准进行了SKILL-RAG的评估。实验结果表明，SKILL-RAG不仅提高了生成质量，还显著减少了输入文档的数量。

**Conclusion:** 通过实验证明了自我知识在指导高质量检索选择中的重要性，验证了SKILL-RAG方法的有效性。

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

### [7] [Beyond Global Emotion: Fine-Grained Emotional Speech Synthesis with Dynamic Word-Level Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20378)
*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

> 介绍Emo-FiLM，一种基于LLM的细粒度情感建模框架，用于文本到语音的转换。实验表明，该方法在实现情感语音合成方面表现出色。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的E-TTS系统通常依赖于预定义标签、参考音频或自然语言提示进行句子级控制，这些方法对于全局情感表达有效，但无法捕捉句子中的动态变化。为了解决这个问题，提出了Emo-FiLM框架。

**Method:** Emo-FiLM, 一个基于LLM的细粒度情感建模框架，通过将情感向量的情感特征对齐到单词级别以获取单词级情感注释，并通过特征线性调制（FiLM）层直接调制文本嵌入来实现单词级别的情感控制。

**Result:** 实验表明，Emo-FiLM在全局和细粒度任务上均优于现有方法，证明了其实现情感语音合成的有效性和通用性。为了支持评估，构建了包含情感转换详细注释的FEDD数据集。

**Conclusion:** Emo-FiLM框架通过细粒度的情感建模在情感驱动的文本到语音合成中表现优异，为生成自然且可信的人机语音交互奠定了基础。

**Abstract:** Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

### [8] [USB-Rec: An Effective Framework for Improving Conversational Recommendation Capability of Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20381)
*Jianyu Wen,Jingyun Wang,Cilin Yan,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

> Proposes an integrated training-inference framework for enhancing conversational recommendations with LLMs, outperforming existing methods in experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the gap in existing LLMs-based approaches in conversational recommender systems by focusing on the training aspect as well as leveraging their summarization and analysis capabilities.

**Method:** User-Simulator-Based (USB-Rec) framework which includes a LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL training and a Self-Enhancement Strategy (SES) at the inference stage.

**Result:** Extensive experiments on various datasets show consistent outperformance over previous state-of-the-art methods.

**Conclusion:** The integrated training-inference framework, User-Simulator-Based (USB-Rec), effectively improves the performance of large language models in conversational recommendation.

**Abstract:** Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

> 提出Conformal Importance Summarization方法，首次实现重要性保持摘要生成，并提供严格、与分布无关的覆盖保证，适用于高风险领域。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管大型语言模型帮助自动摘要系统取得了显著的进步，但在医疗、法律和金融等高风险领域，这些系统仍未能够可靠地保证关键内容的包含。为了在这些领域实现更可靠的摘要生成，提出了符合重要性摘要框架。

**Method:** 使用符合预测方法，通过校准句子重要性评分的阈值来实现能够控制覆盖率和召回率的抽取式文档摘要生成，该方法与模型无关，并能无缝集成现有的黑盒大语言模型，仅需少量校准数据集。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，符合重要性摘要框架能够在既定的理论保证下实现信息覆盖率。

**Conclusion:** 通过将符合重要性摘要与现有技术结合，该方法能够实现出可靠的、可控制的自动摘要生成，并为AI摘要工具在关键领域的安全部署铺平道路。

**Abstract:** Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

> MARS通过角色设定，减少了智能体交互频率，在保持推理质量和准确性的同时，降低了计算成本。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于单个大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理能力上存在局限性，而多智能体辩论（MAD）则因涉及较多的智能体和频繁沟通，导致了较高的计算成本。因此，本研究旨在设计出一种减少计算成本的同时提升推理能力的方法。

**Method:** 本研究提出了MARS（多智能体评审系统）框架，通过设定作者、评审者和元评审者三种角色，有效地减少了智能体之间的交互，提升了推理质量和效率，同时降低了计算成本。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，MARS在多个基准测试中能与MAD达到相同的准确度，同时将标记使用量和推理时间减少了约50%。

**Conclusion:** 研究证明了MARS框架的有效性以及在减少计算成本上的优势。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at

**Motivation:** 近年来，虽然机器翻译取得了重要的进展，但对于缺乏大规模训练数据和语言资源的许多低资源语言，进展仍然有限。本文正是为了弥补这一点，以超过8000万使用者的粤语和吴语为例。

**Method:** 介绍了SiniticMTError数据集，该数据集基于现有的平行语料库对从英语到粤语和吴语的机器翻译错误进行标注，包括错误范围、错误类型和严重程度的标注。

**Result:** 该数据集可用于微调具有错误检测能力的模型，并支持翻译质量估计、错误感知生成以及低资源语言评估的研究。

**Conclusion:** 通过严格的标注流程，包括多方标注的一致性分析、迭代反馈和错误类型及严重程度的模式分析，证明了该数据集的可靠性。

**Abstract:** Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

*Ayan Sar,Pranav Singh Puri,Sumit Aich,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了SwasthLLM，一种统一的、零样本的、跨语言的多任务学习框架，用于医疗诊断，能够在英语、印地语和孟加拉语间有效操作，无需特定语言微调。通过多语言XLM-RoBERTa编码器搭配语言感知注意力机制和疾病分类头，并采用对比学习模块和翻译一致性模块，该框架实现了在不同语言上高准确性诊断。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 多语言医疗环境中自动病征诊断面临挑战，原因在于低资源语言注释医疗数据稀缺以及不同人群之间语言差异显著。

**Method:** SwasthLLM使用多语言XLM-RoBERTa编码器，结合语言感知注意力机制、疾病分类头、对比学习模块和翻译一致性模块，采用MAML强化少数据场景快速适应能力，通过多任务学习策略联合优化疾病分类、翻译对齐和对比学习目标。

**Result:** SwasthLLM在监督学习中达到97.22%的测试准确率和97.17%的F1值，而在零样本环境下，Hindi的准确性高达92.78%，Bengali的则为73.33%，在低资源语言情况下展现良好泛化能力。

**Conclusion:** SwasthLLM在多个国家语言背景下实现了高质量的自动病征诊断，尤其是在低资源语言环境下展示出了强大的泛化能力。

**Abstract:** In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

> DS-MoE提出了一种深度专用的专家混合模型，通过动态组装定制的推理链来提高语言模型的效率和质量。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的Transformer架构对所有输入应用相同的处理深度，造成资源浪费和推理质量受限。

**Method:** DS-MoE引入了优化不同推理深度的专家模块，并通过学习路由网络动态组合这些模块以匹配输入复杂度。

**Result:** 实验结果显示DS-MoE在计算、推理速度和复杂多步推理的准确性上优于传统的Transformer模型。

**Conclusion:** DS-MoE证明了深度专用模型可以同时改善效率、推理质量和可解释性，标志着自适应神经网络架构的重要进展。

**Abstract:** Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

> 本文提出的HRT 模型通过多分辨率注意力机制，实现了对文本的层次化处理，相比标准Transformer 模型，不仅减少了计算复杂度且在多个基准测试集上表现出了更高的性能和更好的资源利用效率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有Transformer 架构在处理自然语言任务中虽然取得了最先进的性能，但它们从根本上来说错误地将其视为扁平标记序列，忽略了语言的层次结构。这种处理方式导致了二次计算成本，弱的组合泛化能力和不足的语篇建模能力。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为分层解析Transformer (HRT) 的新颖的、受小波启发的神经架构，该架构可以同时在多个分辨率级别上处理语言，从字符到语篇级别。HRT 构建了多分辨率注意力，实现了自下而上的组合和自上而下的上下文化。通过在多个尺度上进行指数级序列简化，HRT 达到了 O(nlogn) 的复杂度，比标准Transformer 提供了显著的效率改进。

**Result:** 在包括GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena 和WikiText-103 在内的多样化基准测试上评估了HRT。结果显示HRT 比标准Transformer 基线模型在GLUE 上高出3.8%, SuperGLUE 上高出4.5%, Long Range Arena 上高出6.1%。同时，相较于参数数量相当的BERT 和GPT 风格模型，内存使用减少42%，推理延时降低了37%。

**Conclusion:** HRT 作为第一个将计算结构与人类语言的层次结构对齐的架构，证明了多尺度、小波启发的处理方法在理论效率和实践语言理解能力上的提升。通过削弱自下而上的组合能力和自上而下的上下文化能力，显著提高了效率和准确性。

**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

> FS-DFM, a new sampling method for language models, significantly improves speed while maintaining quality, leading to a 128 times faster sampling process, achieving perplexity parity with a 1,024-step baseline with only 8 steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The primary motivation is to enhance the throughput and reduce latency for long sequences in language generation models, addressing the issue where autoregressive models limit efficiency due to their serial nature, and standard diffusion processes require numerous model evaluations to achieve high-quality outputs.

**Method:** Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching (FS-DFM) is introduced to optimize the sampling speed of Diffusion Language Models without reducing quality. The model allows specifying the number of sampling steps and aims to be consistent across different step budgets, ensuring stability and accuracy.

**Result:** FS-DFM with 8 steps outperforms a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline in terms of speed, achieving comparable perplexity on language modeling benchmarks with a much smaller number of steps, hence enhancing throughput and reducing latency.

**Conclusion:** The paper demonstrates that FS-DFM provides a strong balance between speed and quality in the context of language generation, marking a significant step towards efficient sampling techniques for language models.

**Abstract:** Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

**Motivation:** 解决大型语言模型评价瓶颈，即建构基准，评估模型和设置，进而迭代。提出是否能提前预测实验结果的设想。

**Method:** 通过构建PRECOG（一个包含抹去描述与性能配对的数据集），研究文本性能预测：从抹去的任务描述和预定配置中估计模型得分，而不接触数据集实例。

**Result:** 实验显示任务具有挑战性但可行。模型配备了一种可以排除源论文的检索模块，能够实现中等预测性能，且不确定性校准良好，在准确性子集上达到最高的置信度阈值时，平均绝对误差低至8.7。

**Conclusion:** 初步迈向开放性前瞻性评估，支持难度估计和实验优先级的智能设定。

**Abstract:** Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

Main category: cs.CL

> A study presents methods for enhancing Japanese speech recognition, tailored for speaking assessment tasks, which utilize multitask training and the fusion of two estimation methods. The techniques resulted in a significant reduction of error rates compared to multilingual generic recognizers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve speech recognition accuracy in Japanese, particularly with the inclusion of accent markers, given the scarcity of training data for such specific tasks.

**Method:** The paper proposes two methods to build a speech recognizer for Japanese speaking assessment tasks. The first method uses multitask training to include orthographic text labels and pitch patterns, utilizing additional data with only orthographic annotations. The second method combines two estimation approaches using a finite-state transducer framework.

**Result:** The proposed methods led to an improvement in the phonemic recognition accuracy, reducing the mora-label error rate from 12.3% to 7.1% in the CSJ core evaluation sets.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the proposed methods of using multitask learning and fusing two estimators are effective for building a precise phonemic recognizer and demonstrate advantages over multilingual recognizers in specific tasks.

**Abstract:** This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

**Motivation:** 尽管图神经网络（GNN）和自监督学习方法在分子属性预测方面取得了进展，但结合人类先验知识仍然是必不可少的。目前的方法利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行知识提取。然而，LLMs受限于知识空白和幻觉，特别是在较少研究的分子属性上。

**Method:** 提出了一种全新的框架，首次将从大型语言模型（LLMs）提取的知识与预训练分子模型衍生的结构特征相结合，以增强分子属性预测（MPP）。该方法首先提示大型语言模型生成领域相关知识和分子向量化可执行代码，然后将这些知识型特征与结构表示进行融合。

**Result:** 实验显示，该集成方法优于现有方法，表明LLM衍生知识与结构信息的结合为MPP提供了一种强大而有效的解决方案。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，融入LLM衍生知识的分子属性预测方法在解决分子属性预测时的表现优于传统方法，证明了这种新颖框架的有效性。

**Abstract:** Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

**Motivation:** 由于攻击检测模型的可靠性尚未被充分探索，本文旨在研究这些检测模型在面对新的攻击手段时的有效性，并探讨人类如何评估检测模型的可靠性。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种新的攻击设置和攻击手段RedHerring，旨在通过修改文本使攻击检测模型产生误报，同时保持分类器的正确性，从而创建了分类器和检测器之间的紧张关系。此外，作者测试了这种新型威胁模型在4个数据集上对3种检测器和4个分类器的防御效果，并提出了一种简单的置信度检查作为初步防御措施。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，RedHerring能够将检测准确性降低20-71个百分点，同时保持或提高了分类器的准确性。初步防御方法——置信度检查，显著提高了检测准确性，并提出了一种新的威胁模型，揭示了对手可能如何针对检测模型发起攻击。

**Conclusion:** 本文揭示了现有攻击检测模型的一种潜在缺陷，并证明通过特定方式修改文本可以导致检测模型误报。文章提出的初步防御措施显示出一定的有效性。这些发现对研究和开发更加鲁棒的NLP模型具有重要意义。

**Abstract:** In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To adapt a student model to outperform the LALM in the target domain given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM.

**Method:** MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher.

**Result:** The student model surpassed the LALM and outperformed the strongest baseline by 3.9%.

**Conclusion:** The framework enables consistent gains across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers, achieving a 3.9% improvement over the strongest baseline without sharing source data.

**Abstract:** Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive

**Abstract:** We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity

**Motivation:** 本文旨在重新审视SFT对LLMs通用性能的影响，并探究如何在保持目标领域性能的同时减少对通用性能的损害。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种新的方法Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR)，用于缓解有监督微调（SFT）过程中大型语言模型（LLMs）的通用性能下降问题。此外，还评估了几种减少通用能力损失的策略，如L2正则化、LoRA、模型平均和FLOW。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，虽然没有一种方法可以完全消除这种权衡，但TALR在平衡领域特定增益和通用能力方面比基准方法表现更优。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果被总结为实用指南：使用较小的学习率来实现有利的权衡，当需要更强烈的平衡时，采用TALR作为有效策略。

**Abstract:** Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

**Motivation:** 由于现有神经元和特征在定义大型语言模型内部表示的基本单元时存在局限性，本研究旨在定义一种更稳定且具有可靠重建能力的单元，以推进对LLMs内部机制的理解。

**Method:** 引入了原子内积（AIP）来修正表示偏移，并定义了原子。证明了这些原子满足受限同构特性（RIP），确保在原子集合上的稳定稀疏表示，并通过阈值激活的单层稀疏自编码器（SAEs）验证原子的存在。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，使用阈值激活的稀疏自编码器在Gemma2-2B、Gemma2-9B和Llama3.1-8B上达到了平均99.9%的稀疏重建精度，超过99.8%的原子满足独特性条件，优于现有的神经元和特征。

**Conclusion:** 本研究系统地介绍了和验证了大型语言模型的原子理论，为理解LLMs内部表示提供了一个理论框架，并为进一步提升模型的机械可解释性奠定了基础。

**Abstract:** The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

> 本论文提出了一种名为Conversational Prompting的方法，旨在通过将用户评论重构为多轮对话，解决在只有少量用户评论且无法进行微调的情况下生成个性化评论的问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有方法在生成个性化评论时通常需要用户有丰富的评论历史或需要额外的模型训练。但在少样本和无需训练的场景下，这些方法的效果不佳。大语言模型（LLMs）可以应对这种低资源场景，但其效果依赖于提示工程。因此，提出了Conversational Prompting方法，以解决此问题。

**Method:** 提出两种变体：Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP)直接使用用户自己的评论；Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP)则是插入其他用户或其他LLM生成的评论作为错误回复，促使模型修正错误，进而产生用户风格的评论。

**Result:** 在八个产品领域和五个不同的大语言模型上进行了实验，结果表明传统的非对话式提示生成的评论与随机用户的评论相似，而SCP和CCP生成的评论更接近目标用户。特别是，当每个用户只有两条评论时，这两者的效果依然较好。

**Conclusion:** Conversational Prompting方法为在少样本和无需训练的情况下生成个性化评论提供了实用解决方案。尤其是，当有高质量的负样本时，采用CCP方法能带来进一步的改进，反之，SCP在缺乏此类数据时也保持竞争力。

**Abstract:** Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的方法通常采用资源密集型且不可扩展的工作流程来推理知识图谱，但忽视了图和查询之间的语义差距这一问题。

**Method:** EoG框架通过利用大型语言模型的先验知识来丰富知识图谱，以弥合图和查询之间的语义差距。这一方法能有效地从知识图谱中提取证据，进行精准且稳健的推理，同时保证了较低的计算成本、可扩展性和跨不同方法的适应性。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，EoG能够生成高质量的知识图谱，并且在知识图谱问题回答任务中达到了最先进的性能。

**Conclusion:** 该研究提出了EoG框架和三个用于分析知识图谱问题回答任务中查询图对齐的图质量评估指标，并通过理论验证了其优化目标的有效性。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决小型语言模型在召回方面的不足，同时保留大型语言模型的生成能力和小型监督模型的可靠性。

**Method:** PoCO方法首先通过大语言模型触发过度校正以最大化召回率，允许进行全面的修订，然后通过微调较小的模型来识别并改进错误输出。

**Result:** 实验表明，PoCO方法能有效平衡语法错误纠正的表现，提高召回率并保持有竞争力的精确率。

**Conclusion:** PoCO方法通过结合大型语言模型的生成力和小型模型的可靠性，显著提升了语法错误纠正的质量。

**Abstract:** Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

**Motivation:** 解决大语言模型因长输入token而导致的高计算需求问题，同时保持有效的上下文学习能力。

**Method:** 通过将多示例上下文学习的信息提炼为简洁的文本摘要（cheat sheet），在推理阶段使用该摘要作为上下文。

**Result:** 实验表明，cheat-sheet ICL在具有挑战性的推理任务上能够实现与多示例上下文学习相当或更好的性能，但所需的token数量远少。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，cheat-sheet ICL是一种可行的方法，可有效减少token数量，同时保持高能力执行下游任务。

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 随着大型语言模型在基于云的服务中的广泛应用，用户的输入可能会无意中暴露敏感信息，而现有的文本匿名化和去标识化技术通常难以平衡隐私保护与文本自然性和实用性。

**Method:** 提出了一种零样本、基于树搜索的迭代句子重写算法，该算法系统地模糊或删除个人信息，同时保持连贯性、相关性和自然性。此方法通过奖励模型引导的结构化搜索，逐步重写隐私敏感段落，实现对重写空间的动态探索。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，该方法在隐私保护和实用性的平衡上明显优于现有基线方法。

**Conclusion:** 零样本、基于树搜索的迭代句子重写算法在隐私保护和实用性方面表现出色，能够有效解决隐私泄露问题。

**Abstract:** The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

**Motivation:** 为了提高生成的回答的可验证性，并帮助用户识别潜在的虚构信息，本文提出了生成子句级别引用的方法，以减少用户确认生成输出正确性的努力。

**Method:** 提出了一种生成子句级别引用的框架，该框架利用大规模语言模型自动生成微调数据，并采用了信誉模型来过滤出低质量的样例。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，所提出的方法可以生成高质量且更易读的引用。

**Conclusion:** 研究证明，通过本文提出的方法，可以生成既简洁又充分的子句级别引用，有助于用户更容易验证生成的回答。

**Abstract:** In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

> 本文提出一种加权监督微调方法WeFT，针对扩散模型在语言生成过程中的挑战，有效提升了生成结果在多个推理基准测试中的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管扩散模型在语言建模方面显示出强大的潜力，但对其进行监督微调仍然是一个挑战，因为它们在去噪过程中的每一步缺乏精确的概率估计。此外，虽然扩散机制使模型能够在整个序列上进行推理，但这也使得生成过程变得不太可预测且往往不一致。这突显了控制引导生成方向的关键标记的重要性。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种名为WeFT的方法，这是一种基于熵为扩散模型中的不同标记分配不同权重的加权监督微调方法。

**Result:** 在使用来自open-r1的s1K、s1K-1.1和3k样本进行训练时，在四个广泛使用的推理基准测试（Sudoku、Countdown、GSM8K和MATH-500）上，分别实现了相对提升39%、64%和83%。

**Conclusion:** 通过引入WeFT方法，我们能够在扩散语言模型中提高生成的控制性和一致性，显著提升了在多个推理基准测试中的表现。

**Abstract:** Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

> The study explores prompting and fine-tuning (SFT and RFT) methods to enable medical reasoning models to produce ranked lists of answers to open-ended questions, addressing the limitation of these models generating only single responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation for this work is to address the current limitations of medical reasoning models (MRMs) which are typically trained to generate only one response in open-ended scenarios, even though clinical decision-making often requires considering multiple options. The authors aim to develop a more nuanced approach to answer generation in medical domains, which better aligns with the practical needs of clinicians.

**Method:** The paper proposes two methods for enabling medical reasoning models (MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers: prompting and fine-tuning. Prompting is explored first as a low-cost method to alter the output format of MRMs. However, due to the limitations on generalizing different answer formats with prompting, the paper then investigates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) as alternative approaches. SFT involves teaching the model to imitate annotated responses, while RFT uses reward functions tailored to rank lists to drive the model to explore responses that maximize a reward.

**Result:** The results demonstrate that, while some models trained with SFT can generalize to certain answer formats, models fine-tuned with RFT are more robust across various formats. A case study on a modified MedQA with multiple valid answers shows that although models might fail to always select the benchmark’s preferred answer, they can still identify valid responses.

**Conclusion:** This study is the first to systematically investigate methods for enabling medical reasoning models to generate answers in a ranked format, going beyond single-answer outputs. The research highlights the potential for promoting more flexible answer formats in medical domains, beneficial for improving clinical decision-making.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

**Motivation:** 提出SummQ的动因是现有方法在处理长文档时往往存在信息损失、事实不一致和连贯性问题，需要一种新的方法来改善长文档摘要的质量。

**Method:** SummQ采用了一种新颖的对抗性多智能体框架，该框架包括摘要生成器、摘要审查器、问题生成器、问题审查器和一个验证生成摘要是否包含回答问题所需信息的考生代理。这些代理协同工作以创建并评估全面摘要，并通过迭代反馈机制进行改进。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，SummQ在三个广泛使用的长文本摘要基准测试上，相比现有最先进方法在ROUGE和BERTScore指标上均有显著提升，并且在大语言模型作为裁判和人类评估中表现良好。

**Conclusion:** 这一工作展示了一种通过对抗性智能体协作来改进长文档摘要质量的新途径。

**Abstract:** Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

}

**Conclusion:** 研究证明，MemLens能够有效地识别LLM的记忆行为，并揭示出记忆污染的真正特征。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

**Motivation:** 研究旨在探讨线性和层级视角下的局部性，以及如何通过更精细的衡量标准来解释句子理解过程中的记忆负载。

**Method:** 该研究使用了跨语言的依存树库和谐化的数据集，并采用混合效应模型来分析句子长度、依存距离和介入者复杂度作为记忆负载的预测因子。

**Result:** 研究表明，三个因素与记忆负载呈正相关，其中句子长度影响最大，而介入者复杂度在解释力上超越了线性距离。

**Conclusion:** 概念上，研究将线性和层级视角下的局部性结合，方法上展示了如何使用基于依存树的图度量和跨语言的混合效应模型来区分线性和结构性对处理效率的影响，为评估记忆负载的不同理论提供了原则性的路径。

**Abstract:** This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

**Method:** 本研究通过使用基础版本和经过后续培训的阿拉伯语大型语言模型变体进行广泛实验，探讨了三个关键研究问题：1）使用阿拉伯语原生工具调用数据的必要性与依赖跨语言迁移相比，2）通用指令调优对工具调用性能的影响，3）针对特定高优先级工具进行微调的价值。

**Result:** 研究发现提供了关于开发阿拉伯语增强技能代理的最佳策略的关键见解。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果有助于理解和开发适用于阿拉伯语的工具调用能力，填补了非英语语言工具调用研究的空白。

**Abstract:** Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

**Conclusion:** 大型语言模型驱动的自动评估系统，在合适的评估方法辅助下，有潜力成为学术资源的有益补充，对教育领域有重要的应用价值。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 了解因果掩码在Transformer解码器中的位置信息来源的重要性，以及它如何与显式的位置编码相互作用。

**Method:** 通过理论和实验分析，探讨了因果掩码在没有参数或因果依赖输入的情况下对注意力得分的影响。理论分析表明，因果掩码可以引起倾向于接近查询-键对的注意力模式。实验分析验证了模型训练后的这种行为，并指出学习参数进一步增强了这些模式。

**Result:** 发现因果掩码和RoPE的交互作用会将RoPE的相对注意力得分模式扭曲为非相对模式。这种效果在现代大型语言模型中普遍存在。

**Conclusion:** 强调除了显式的位置编码之外，还需要考虑因果掩码作为位置信息的来源。

**Abstract:** While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

> 研究开发了两个基准测试以及回归模型来评估大型语言模型遵循多指令的能力，发现随着指令数的增加，模型性能降低，且使用相对较少的样本量可以有效估计性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型(Large Language Models, LLMs)越来越多地应用于现实场景，理解它们同时遵循多个指令的能力变得至关重要。

**Method:** 介绍了两个专门的基准测试：ManyIFEval用于文本生成，最多包含十个指令；StyleMBPP用于代码生成，最多包含六个指令。开发了三种回归模型来估计未见过的指令组合和不同数量的指令的表现。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，随着指令数量的增加，性能持续下降。逻辑回归模型使用指令计数作为解释变量，可以预测多指令跟随性能，误差约为10%。表明相对较小的样本量（500个用于ManyIFEval，300个用于StyleMBPP）足以进行性能估计。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，使用相对较小的样本量，就可以有效并高效地估计LLM在不同指令组合下的表现，提高了评估效率。

**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 文中提到，尽管基础模型在各个领域表现出色，但其在复杂多模态工程问题上的表现仍然未被充分探索，因此研究旨在解决这一问题。

**Method:** 我们提出了一个名为SoM-1K的大型多模态基准数据集，该数据集包含1,065个注释的材料强度问题，并提出了一种称为图像描述(DoI)的新型提示策略，以提供对视觉图的详细文本描述。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，当前的基础模型在解决这些工程问题时存在明显困难，最佳表现的模型准确率仅为56.6%。研究发现，在提供DoI的情况下，语言模型的表现往往优于直接提供视觉图的视觉语言模型。

**Conclusion:** 该工作建立了一个严格的工程AI基准，并强调了在科学和工程背景下开发更强大的多模态推理能力的重要性。

**Abstract:** Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

*Yixin Wan,Xingrun Chen,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究者们发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成性应用中存在文化定位偏差，它倾向于以美国主流文化的视角进行生成，而对外部文化采取疏离态度。研究者提出CultureLens基准来量化这种偏差，并提出两种消除偏差的方法：基于提示的公平干预支柱（FIP）方法和结构化公平代理（MFA）框架。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 该研究旨在识别和系统调查大型语言模型中的文化定位偏差问题，并提出解决方案以缓解这种偏差。

**Method:** 作者提出了CultureLens基准，包含4000个生成提示和3个评估指标，通过模拟记者与来自10种不同文化背景的本地人的采访对话来量化文化定位偏差。此外，还提出两种方法来缓解偏差：基于提示的FIP方法和结构化MFA框架。

**Result:** 在5种最先进的大型语言模型上进行的实验显示，模型在处理美国文化背景时超过88%的脚本采用内部视角，而在处理不太占主导地位的文化时则主要采用外部视角。MFA框架下的方法，即单个代理（MFA-SA）和多代理（MFA-MA）被证明是缓解语言模型偏差的有前景的方法。

**Conclusion:** 实验证明，通过采用MFA框架和MFA策略可以使生成的脚本更加公正，对于减少大型语言模型的文化定位偏差具有重要作用。研究结果表明，代理方法为解决生成性语言模型中的偏差提供了重要的思路。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究旨在解决LLMs（尤其是低资源语言如波斯语的）持续存在的幻觉问题，这是影响所有LLM的一个问题。

**Method:** 该研究开发了一个名为PerHalluEval的基准测试，用于评估波斯语的幻觉问题。该基准测试依托于一个三阶段的LLM驱动的流水线以及人类验证来生成与问答和摘要任务相关的合理答案和摘要，集中于检测外在和内在的幻觉。此外，还使用生成标记的对数概率来选择最可信的幻觉实例，并让人类标注者突出波斯语特有的问答数据集中的上下文，以评估LLM在与波斯文化内容相关的任务上的表现。

**Result:** 研究评估了12个LLMs的性能，包括开源和闭源模型。结果显示，这些模型在识别波斯语幻觉文本方面普遍存在问题。提供外部知识（如摘要任务中的原始文档）可以部分缓解幻觉问题。此外，专门用于波斯语训练的LLM与其它模型在幻觉方面没有显著差异。

**Conclusion:** 研究指出，使用PerHalluEval可以有效地评估LLMs在波斯语幻觉检测上的表现，揭示了要解决模型在这个问题上的根本挑战需要更多的研究。

**Abstract:** Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

> BESPOKE是用于评估搜索增强大型语言模型中个性化效果的基准测试，它基于真实的用户数据和详细的反馈构建，揭示了个性化需求的关键因素。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前的搜索增强大型语言模型虽然在某些方面很有能力，但尚不足以全面满足多样的用户需求。这需要系统能识别相同查询在不同用户中反映出的不同意图，并以用户偏好的形式传递信息。现有的系统个人化尝试缺乏系统性评估，因此提出了BESPOKE基准。

**Method:** 提出BESPOKE基准测试，用于评估增强搜索的大型语言模型（LLMs）中的个性化效果。BESPOKE通过收集真实的人类聊天和搜索记录，并结合精细的偏好评分和反馈来设计。该基准通过长期且深入的人类注释构建，参与者提供自己的历史记录，编写带有详细信息需求的查询，并对响应进行评分和提供诊断反馈。

**Result:** 通过使用BESPOKE基准进行的系统分析揭示了在信息检索任务中实现有效个性化的关键要求，并为个性化搜索增强的大型语言模型的精细化评估提供了基础。

**Conclusion:** BESPOKE的出现弥补了现有系统在个性化评估方面的不足，为理解并实现有效个性化提供了工具和方法。开源代码和数据使研究者能够进一步研究和改进个性化搜索增强的大型语言模型。

**Abstract:** Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 这项研究的动机在于评估语音语言模型（SLMs）中的社会偏见，尤其是由于语音的特性，SLMs中的社会偏见可以从内容方面和声学方面显现出来。

**Method:** 我们引入了VoiceBBQ，它是BBQ（问答偏见基准测试）的语音扩展，用于衡量社会偏见。该数据集通过提供模糊或明确的上下文后跟可能引发刻板反应的问题来检测偏见。VoiceBBQ 将每个BBQ上下文转换为受控的语音条件，可以分别评估内容和声学方面的准确性和偏见性。

**Result:** 我们使用VoiceBBQ评估了两个SLMs（LLaMA-Omni和Qwen2-Audio），观察到它们在抵抗声音偏见和放大内容偏见方面的架构差异。

**Conclusion:** VoiceBBQ提供了一个紧凑的、可插入的测试平台，用于同时诊断语音语言模型的内容和声音偏见。

**Abstract:** We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

**Motivation:** 动机在于探索当前的SpeechLMs在处理男性和女性声音时是否存在基于声音的性别偏差现象。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种新的数据集，包含9,208个语音样本，分为三类：性别无关、性别刻板印象和性别相关，用以系统分析语音语言模型中的性别区分现象。

**Result:** 研究发现，尽管多数情况下模型的反应看似和提问者的性别无关，但在性别刻板印象的问题上，模型常常表现出偏向男性的反应，而在性别相关的问题上，模型却未能体现出性别差异。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现揭示了当前的SpeechLMs在利用性别信息时仍存在不足，需要更先进的技术以妥善使用性别信息，确保其既能符合公平原则，又能适应具体的语境。

**Abstract:** Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的基于分类的关系抽取方法忽视了结构约束和语义表达能力，因此，作者提出了ROC框架来弥补这些不足。

**Method:** ROC框架将多模态关系抽取重新定义为由关系语义驱动的检索任务，整合实体类型和位置信息，利用大语言模型扩展关系标签为自然语言描述，并通过基于语义相似性的对比学习对齐实体-关系对。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，该方法在MNRE和MORE基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能，并且具有更强的鲁棒性和可解释性。

**Conclusion:** 通过对比实验验证，ROC框架证明了其在多模态关系抽取中的优越性能，特别是在鲁棒性和可解释性方面。

**Abstract:** Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

**Motivation:** 研究动机在于识别语言模型中句法结构和领域知识之间的不希望的相关性，并探讨这些相关性对模型性能和安全性的潜在负面影响。

**Method:** 该研究使用了一个合成的训练数据集来研究句法域之间的相关性，并开发了一个评估框架来检测训练模型中的这种现象。研究集中在识别句法模板、领域和指令对的语义之间的关系，并特别关注于分析这些关系是否会对模型的性能产生负面影响，特别是在实体知识任务中。此外，研究还通过案例研究探讨了对安全微调的影响，展示了如何利用意外的句法-域相关性来绕过指令模型的限制。

**Result:** 研究发现句法域相关性可以降低 OLMO-2 模型在实体知识任务上的性能。此外，这些相关性在训练好的模型中确实存在，并且可以被用于绕过某些模型的拒绝指令。

**Conclusion:** 研究结论强调了在测试中明确检测句法-域相关性的需求，以及在训练数据内确保句法多样性，特别是特定领域内的句法多样性，以防止这些不希望的相关性的重要性。

**Abstract:** For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

**Abstract:** The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

Main category: cs.CL

> This paper proposes GEP, a new method to detect PII leakage in small language models (SLMs). It shows improvements of up to 60 times more leakage detection compared to template-based methods even in complex conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study was motivated by the lack of exploration into PII leakage in small language models (SLMs) for downstream tasks. It aims to fill this gap by investigating the PII leakage of SLMs for chatbots.

**Method:** The paper adopts a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method, named GEP, to extract personally identifiable information (PII) from a small language model (SLM) chatbot. They fine-tune a new chatbot, ChatBioGPT, based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca and HealthCareMagic.

**Result:** The proposed GEP method, compared to previous template-based methods, can detect up to 60 times more PII leakage. Even with free-style insertion, GEP still successfully reveals a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%. 

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that GEP, a novel PII extraction method, is more effective and robust than existing template-based methods in detecting PII leakage from small language models (SLMs).

**Abstract:** Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

> 提出了一种新的框架，解决了大型语言模型在科学推理中的瓶颈，实现了更高的准确率，同时降低了资源使用。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决大型语言模型在科学推理中遇到的两个主要瓶颈：显式检索中断推理过程，多代理管道通过平均所有候选方案削弱强解。

**Method:** 结合隐式检索和结构化协作的统一框架，基础是基于Monitor的检索模块，它在令牌级别工作，将外部知识与推理过程无缝集成。在此基础上，分层解决方案优化（HSR）迭代地指定每个候选作为锚点，由其同伴修复，而质量感知迭代推理（QAIR）根据解决方案的质量进行调整优化。

**Result:** 在Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold测试集中实现48.3%的准确率，较最强代理基线高13.4个百分点，相较于前沿的LLM模型高18.1个百分点，同时减少了53.5%的令牌使用和43.7%的代理步骤。

**Conclusion:** 研究发现表明，隐式增强和结构化优化克服了显式工具使用和均匀聚合的低效率。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

### [55] [CLaw: Benchmarking Chinese Legal Knowledge in Large Language Models - A Fine-grained Corpus and Reasoning Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21208)
*Xinzhe Xu,Liang Zhao,Hongshen Xu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

> 此论文介绍了一个专门评估大型语言模型在中文法律知识及其应用推理上的基准测试CLaw。大多数现代LLMs在准确再现法律条文方面存在重大挑战，这严重降低了它们对法律推理的可靠性。CLaw为改进领域特定的LLM推理提供了一个基准和重要见解。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前，大型语言模型在分析法律文本和引用相关内容方面存在可靠性问题，主要是因为一般预训练忽略了法律领域的专业关注点。因此，作者提出CLaw来评估和发现这些模型在中文法律业务中的不足。

**Method:** 此论文引入了一个新的基准测试CLaw，用于评估大型语言模型在中文法律知识及其推理应用方面的表现。CLaw包含两个核心组件：1)一个全面细分的306个中国国家法规的细粒度语料库，包含64,849项历史修订时间步长，用于严格的召回评估；2)一套基于案例的254个推理实例，用于测试模型的应用法律知识能力。

**Result:** 通过实验评估，作者发现大多数现代大型语言模型在忠实复制法律条款上面临着重大挑战，这表明这些模型的可靠性和法律推理的基础受到了严重打击。

**Conclusion:** 为了使大型语言模型在法律推理领域的表现更为可靠，它们需要结合强大的知识检索能力（可能通过加强监督微调或检索增强生成进行改进）和强健的一般推理能力。此工作提供了一个关键的基准和见解，以推动领域特定的LLM推理领域的进步，特别是在复杂的法律领域。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

*Yaxiong Wu,Yongyue Zhang,Sheng Liang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

> SGMem, a novel memory management approach for conversational AI, structures dialogues into sentence-level graphs to better organize and retrieve information, enhancing long-term dialogue performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Long-term conversational agents need effective memory management to deal with dialogue histories beyond the context window of LLMs. Existing methods are not proficient at organizing and retrieving information across different dialogue scopes.

**Method:** SGMem (Sentence Graph Memory) represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and session-level contexts.

**Result:** Experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo demonstrate that SGMem enhances accuracy and surpasses strong baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

**Conclusion:** SGMem offers a superior memory management solution for long-term conversational agents, improving their performance in question answering over extended periods.

**Abstract:** Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

> QCG-RAG解决了图粒度与上下文和关系捕捉之间的困境，它提供了一种新的多跳推理方法，在准确性和解释性方面优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的基于图的检索增强生成方法在细粒度实体图和粗粒度文档图之间存在着粒度困境。细粒度实体图会导致高昂的令牌成本并会丢失上下文信息，而粗粒度的文档图则无法捕捉到细微的关系。

**Method:** QCG-RAG采用了一种查询中心的图RAG框架，该框架能够实现查询粒度的索引和多跳片段检索，采用Doc2Query和Doc2Query--来构建查询中心的图，具有可控的粒度，提高了图的质量和可解释性。

**Result:** 实验表明，QCG-RAG在问题回答准确性方面始终优于先前的基于片段和基于图的RAG方法。

**Conclusion:** QCG-RAG确立了一种新的多跳推理范式，展示出其在问题回答准确性方面的优越性能。

**Abstract:** Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

> 本文解决大语言模型输出响应同质化问题，提出任务依赖性方法评估和减少同质化，同时保持响应质量，挑战了质量和多样化之间的传统权衡观念。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 文章动机在于解决先前工作中未能以任务依赖的方式概念化多样性的不足，特别关注到大语言模型会因为输出响应同质化而降低其效用。

**Method:** 本文提出了一个由八个任务类别组成的任务分类法，每个类别都有自己独特的输出同质化概念。此外，引入了任务锚定的功能多样性来更好地评估输出同质化现象，并提出了一个任务锚定的采样技术，该技术能够在需要同质化的地方保持同质化，而在不需要的地方增加功能多样性。最后，作者挑战了多样性与质量之间存在权衡的传统观念，在增加功能性多样性的同时保持响应质量。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，通过任务依赖的方法可以有效地评估和缓解输出同质化问题，同时保持甚至提高多样性，在多种任务中，响应质量稳定，无需在质量和多样性之间做权衡。

**Conclusion:** 文章总体上展示了任务依赖性如何改进输出同质化的评估和缓解工作，并且证明了在增加功能性多样性的过程中可以保持响应质量，挑战了多样性与质量之间的传统权衡观念。

**Abstract:** A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

> 为了应对当前AI文本检测数据集的局限性，本文提出了一个双语的大规模数据集LLMTrace，用于AI文本检测以及AI生成部分的精确定位。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 动机在于现有数据集多是由过时模型生成的、主要以英语为主，且无法处理越来越多见的混合人类和AI作者身份的情况。此外，没有数据集提供字符级注释以精确定位文本中的AI生成部分，因此开发一个更全面的数据集来训练和评估更加细致和实用的AI检测模型成为一种需求。

**Method:** 本研究通过构建一个名为LLMTrace的新大规模双语（英语和俄语）语料库来解决现有AI文本检测数据集的问题。该语料库由多种现代专有和开源大规模语言模型创建，旨在支持传统全文字本二分类任务（人类 vs AI）以及通过字符级注释辅助的AI生成区间检测任务。

**Result:** LLMTrace可以作为一个宝贵资源，用于训练和评估下一代更加细致和实用的AI检测模型。项目的页面可以在	exttt{https://sweetdream779.github.io/LLMTrace-info/}找到。

**Conclusion:** 本研究强调了LLMTrace作为一个新的、具备字符级标注的大规模双语语料库的重要性，它能够支持两种关键任务，有助于推进AI生成文本检测技术的发展。

**Abstract:** The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

> 本文理论分析了输入扰动对CoT输出波动的影响，证明了输入扰动上界与推理步骤数正相关，且任意长度的推理过程都无法消除这些影响。实验结果验证了这些发现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有研究表明，输入扰动对CoT输出影响显著，虽然很多人试图通过优化提示来缓解这种影响，但缺乏对这种扰动影响机制的理论解释。这限制了我们对输入扰动如何在推理过程中传播的理解，阻碍了改进方法的进一步发展。

**Method:** 本文通过理论分析，探讨了输入扰动对CoT（Chain-of-Thought）输出波动的影响。首先推导出在输出波动处于可接受范围内的前提下，输入扰动的上界。接着分析了LSA（Linear Self-Attention）模型的输入扰动上界与其输入嵌入向量和隐藏状态向量范数之间的关系。

**Result:** 理论分析证明了输入扰动的上界与CoT中的推理步骤数成正比，即使推理过程无限长也不能完全消除输入扰动的影响。在LSA模型中，输入扰动上界与输入嵌入向量和隐藏状态向量的范数负相关。实验结果验证了理论分析的正确性。

**Conclusion:** 通过理论分析和实验验证，本文证明了CoT输出波动与输入扰动之间的关系，对于理解输入扰动如何影响推理过程及改善提示优化方法具有重要意义。

**Abstract:** Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

> DisCoCLIP enhances vision-language models by integrating explicit syntactic structure, leading to better performance in compositional reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitation of current vision-language models in handling the compositional nature of language, specifically word order and predicate-argument structure.

**Method:** Recent models fail at structural language understanding but DisCoCLIP integrates a frozen CLIP for vision and a new tensor network encoder for text. It parses sentences with a grammar parser to align syntax with semantics and factorizes tensors to reduce parameters efficiently.

**Result:** The model significantly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and word order, achieving a 4.8% increase in verb accuracy on SVO-Probes, along with substantial gains in ARO attribution and relation scores, and reaching 93.7% on SVO-Swap.

**Conclusion:** Embedding linguistic structure via tensor networks leads to more interpretable and parameter-efficient models that enhance compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

**Abstract:** Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 创建和评估具有文化背景的合成数据集对于多语言和多文化环境中的AI系统至关重要，特别是在资源有限的情况下。目前，这种数据的有效性尚未得到充分探索。

**Method:** 通过从特定语言的维基百科内容出发，提出了一种自下而上的生成策略，用大型开源语言模型（>=235B参数）来生成针对印度13种语言的高质量、大规模合成指令跟随数据集Updesh，包含950万数据点，涉及多样化的推理和生成任务，强调长上下文和多轮对话能力，并与印度文化背景相融合。

**Result:** 评估表明生成的数据质量较高，但在人类评估中也指出了需要改进的领域。模型在基于Updesh的数据集上训练后，在生成任务中取得了显著的性能提升，并在多项选择风格的自然语言理解任务中表现得具有竞争力，尤其是在低资源和中资源语言中的表现尤为突出。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果提供了实证证据，有效的多语言AI需要结合多方面的数据整理和生成策略，包括带有文化意识的生成方法。

**Abstract:** Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型常常表现出奉承行为，如与用户过度同意或奉承，但不明确这些行为是源于单一机制还是多个不同过程。研究的动机是探讨这些行为背后的原因及机制。

**Method:** 使用差异平均方向、激活添加以及跨多个模型和数据集的子空间几何分析，将奉承行为分解为奉承式同意与奉承式赞美，并将其与真诚的同意进行对比。

**Result:** 研究结果表明：(1)这三种行为在潜在空间中沿不同线性方向进行编码；(2)可以独立地放大或抑制每种行为而不会影响其他行为；(3)它们的表现结构在不同模型家族和尺度上是一致的。

**Conclusion:** 该研究结果表明奉承行为对应于不同的、可独立调节的表示形式。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前RLHF方法存在解释性和奖励操控的问题，而RLVR方法受限于其校验器的正确性聚焦，因此提出了一种新的方法来解决这些问题。

**Method:** 提出了一种结合了人类驱动偏好和基于规则验证精确性的新型强化学习方法——Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF)。该方法从自然语言反馈中提取可二值化的原则（如信息准确与否），并将这些原则作为奖赏模型训练的推理任务。

**Result:** 实验表明，按照RLBFF训练的奖赏模型在多个基准测试中表现出色，特别是在RM-Bench和JudgeBench上分别达到了86.2%和81.4%的顶尖性能。

**Conclusion:** RLBFF模式训练出的奖赏模型在RM-Bench和JudgeBench基准上取得了顶尖性能，且用户可以自定义奖赏模型关注的原则，相比Bradley-Terry模型更具灵活性。此外，该方法提供了完全开源的Qwen3-32B对齐方案，使用较小的推理成本实现了与o3-mini和DeepSeek R1相当或超越的性能。

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

language with heterogeneous scientific representations. The model is pretrained
on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and
sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed
cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and
reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills
deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering
up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and
scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction,
(iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence
generation and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens
instruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances
fidelity. We detail data curation and training and show that cross-discipline
learning strengthens transfer and downstream reliability. The model, instruct

> 本文提出了一种使用NTPs的高效幻觉检测方法，比传统的VLM检测方法更快速且效果相当，有望成为提高VLMs可靠性的一种简单解决方案。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 幻觉检测对于保证VLMs的可靠性至关重要，然而，使用VLMs进行幻觉检测计算成本高，会增加模型的延迟。本文旨在提出一种高效的幻觉检测方法。

**Method:** 通过训练传统的机器学习模型来检测视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的幻觉，这些模型基于VLMs的下一个词概率（NTPs）。

**Result:** 结果表明，NTPs是幻觉预测的有效特征，即使简单的ML模型也能达到与强大的VLMs相媲美的性能。将NTPs与仅基于生成文本的VLMs的NLPs相结合，进一步提高了幻觉检测性能。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果支持了使用NTPs作为幻觉的有效预测特征，并展示了如何将这种方法集成到更复杂的模型中，以实现更好的幻觉检测。这为提高VLMs的可靠性奠定了基础。

**Abstract:** Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

> 本研究提出了基于黎曼几何的准合成数据生成框架，用于离线手写签名验证，尤其是对未见过作者的签名进行识别，通过实验验证了这种方法在两种流行的签名数据集上的有效性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 离线手写签名验证仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务，尤其是在作者独立的设置中，模型需要跨越未见过的个人进行泛化。尽管过去或现在的手工或数据驱动方法通常依赖于现实世界的签名数据集进行分类器训练，本研究提出了一种新的解决方案。

**Method:** 通过引入准合成数据生成框架利用对称正定矩阵（SPD）的黎曼几何，少量的真实样本在SPD空间中作为种子，通过黎曼高斯混合模型来识别合成作者和其属性的方差。通过对每个中心进行黎曼高斯抽样，生成了正的和负的合成SPD群体。然后通过度量学习框架来利用相似和不相似的SPD点对，从而测试其在现实世界数据集上的表现。

**Result:** 在两种流行的签名数据集上进行的实验涵盖了西方和亚洲书写风格，结果表明提出的准合成方法可以实现低错误率，显示了在黎曼空间生成合成数据对于作者独立签名验证系统的潜力。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果证明了利用准合成数据的方法在签名验证任务中的有效性，特别是在作者独立的情况下。这表明该方法可以提高模型在未见过个人上的泛化能力。

**Abstract:** Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

**Motivation:** 目的是将Seedream 4.0扩展为一个更交互式和多维的创意工具，推动生成AI在创作和专业应用方面的边界。

**Method:** 介绍了一种名为Seedream 4.0的高效高性能多模态图像生成系统，该系统能够在单一框架内统一文本到图像（T2I）合成、图像编辑和多图像组合等功能。开发了一个高效的扩散变压器，配以强大的VAE，能大幅减少图像标记的数量，从而使得训练更高效，并且能够快速生成高分辨率图像（例如1K-4K）。通过预训练数十亿的文本图像对，覆盖各种形态和知识中心概念，结合数百个垂直场景的数据收集和优化策略，保证了大规模训练的稳定性和泛化能力。通过精心微调VLM模型，进行多模态后训练，同时训练T2I和图像编辑任务。为了加速推理，集成了对抗性知识蒸馏、分布匹配、量化以及推测性解码等技术，实现生成2K图像时的推理时间为1.8秒（不使用LLM/VLM作为PE模型）。

**Result:** 系统在T2I和多模态图像编辑任务上可以实现最先进的结果，特别在复杂任务中的多模态能力表现优异，包括精确的图像编辑和上下文推理，以及允许多图像参考和生成多个输出图像。

**Conclusion:** Seedream 4.0已经可以在https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream上获取。

**Abstract:** We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于现有深学习方法在标注数据有限的情况下存在准确性问题，研究旨在解决深度学习在乳腺癌检测中遇到的训练数据瓶颈。

**Method:** 采用对比学习框架，在半监督的情况下使用了大量的未标注的乳腺X光片数据来训练Resnet-50模型，并在小量的标注数据上进行微调。

**Result:** 模型在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上实现了96.7%的乳腺癌检测准确率。

**Conclusion:** 提出的半监督对比学习方法提高了在标注数据不足的情况下乳腺癌检测的准确性，表明该方法在实际应用中的潜力。

**Abstract:** Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

**Method:** 分析的是将基础模型应用于工业图像质量检测的任务。通过对比使用这些模型处理私有真实世界数据和公开基准数据的表现来评估模型的有效性。

**Result:** 测试了多个基础模型在私人真实工业图像数据和公开基准图像数据上的表现。结果表明，这些模型在真实数据上的表现较差，而在公开数据集上的表现良好。

**Conclusion:** 尽管基础模型在概念上能减少标记任务的工作量和跨产品的模型设置，但在实际的工业图像数据中却无法达到预期的性能。表明它们当前在工业应用中仍存在局限。

**Abstract:** Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this work is to address the inefficiency of current AI models in imaging and vision, which are customized for specific tasks and require independent latent domains for each. We aim to create a versatile system supporting modular tasks without the need for distinct models.

**Method:** Our work introduces a Universal Neural Space (NS) using an encoder-decoder framework. The encoder learns transformation-aware, generalizable representations across various vision and imaging tasks. This shared feature space reduces redundancy and improves generalization.

**Result:** The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS framework, showing that various imaging and vision tasks (demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation, semantic segmentation) can be efficiently performed within the same feature space, reducing computational redundancy.

**Conclusion:** In conclusion, our Universal Neural Space (NS) architecture offers a lightweight, CNN-based solution for multi-task vision pipelines that enhances efficiency and generalization across different domains, thus significantly reducing the redundancy present in task-specific models.

**Abstract:** The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

**Result:** 研究得出，对于相似的训练量，这种高置信度流策略与多样化方法结合能够生成高质量的模型，并只需要较少的数据集查询。

**Conclusion:** 高置信度流策略与基于多样化的图像选择方法能够在相似训练量下显著提高模型质量和减少传输成本。

**Abstract:** Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的虚拟试衣方法经常使用二值掩膜来控制生成布局，但生成一个能产生理想结果的掩膜是困难的，且需要背景知识，甚至在某些情况下是不可能的。InstructVTON旨在通过引入视觉语言模型和图像分割模型的自动化掩膜生成，以简化用户试衣体验并克服这些限制。

**Method:** 该研究提出了InstructVTON，一个基于自然语言指导的交互式虚拟试衣系统，该系统能够实现单个或多个衣物的精细和复杂风格控制。它将虚拟试衣问题形式化为基于图像引导或图像条件下的填充任务。通过视觉语言模型（VLM）和图像分割模型自动化生成二值掩膜，以简化用户使用体验，克服传统方法中需要精确绘制掩膜并且对于某些造型控制（如卷起袖子）不可行的问题。

**Result:** InstructVTON能够自动执行多轮图像生成，以实现那些仅靠掩膜技术无法完成的试穿场景，展示出与现有虚拟试衣模型的互操作性，并实现具有风格控制能力的最新技术水平。

**Conclusion:** InstructVTON的实现证明了能够与现有的虚拟试衣模型进行互操作，通过自然语言指导和自动化掩膜生成的方法，实现了具有风格控制能力的试衣技术，达到业界领先水平。

**Abstract:** We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

**Motivation:** 鉴于伪造的手印能够在边境控制、刑侦和财政准入等应用中逃避检测，因此对手印识别系统来说，识别经过修改的手印是至关重要的。

**Method:** 本文提出了DeepAFRNet，这是一种深度学习识别模型，用来匹配和识别经过修改的手印样本。它采用VGG16作为骨干网络来提取高维特征，并使用余弦相似性来比较特征嵌入。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，在三个不同难度等级（简单、中等、困难）上，严格阈值下DeepAFRNet的识别准确率分别为96.7%、98.76%和99.54%。此外，通过阈值敏感性研究，当放松阈值时，准确率会有明显下降，表明在生物识别系统中阈值选择的重要性。

**Conclusion:** DeepAFRNet通过使用真实修改样本和报告逐级指标，解决了以往工作基于合成修改或有限验证协议的局限性，证明了其在诸如安全性和识别鲁棒性至关重要的实际场景中部署的可能性。

**Abstract:** Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

**Abstract:** Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)

consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for

smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with

**Abstract:** Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free

under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

> 提出了FacadeTrack框架，它使用街景图像和语言指引，对灾后建筑占用状态进行评估，相较于单阶段策略，两阶段决策策略表现更优。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 在灾害后，楼栋级别的占用状态对于分类救治、检查、重新供电及公平资源分配至关重要。然而，空中的图像提供了快速的覆盖，却常常忽略了决定居住性的立面和进入线索，而街拍图像虽然捕捉了这些细节，但其稀疏性和难以与地块对齐。

**Method:** FacadeTrack是一个基于街景的，语言指导框架，它将全景视频链接到地块上，矫正视角到立面，并提取可解释的属性（例如入口阻塞、临时覆盖物、局部碎片）来推动两种决策策略：一种透明的单阶段规则和一种两阶段设计，后者将感知与保守推理分开。

**Result:** 通过对两次飓风Helene后的调查进行评估，两阶段方法的精度为0.927，召回率为0.781，F-1得分为0.848，而单阶段基线的精度为0.943，召回率为0.728，F-1得分为0.822。除了精确度以外，中间属性和空间诊断还揭示了剩余错误发生的时间和原因，从而能够进行有针对性的质量控制。

**Conclusion:** 这个管道提供了一个具有可审计性、规模化的占用状态评估方法，适用于集成到地理空间和紧急管理工作中，对灾后应急管理至关重要。

**Abstract:** Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管此前的研究多着眼于视觉特征，但该论文的动机在于探究人类使用的语义表示，以补充传统的视觉特征分析。

**Method:** 本研究通过两个实验来探究人类是如何通过简单的动态形状来识别社交互动。实验一中，要求参与者根据动态形状的外观给动画标注标签。实验二中，研究人员测量了27种社交互动的表示几何形状，并将其与基于视觉特征、标签以及动画描述的语义嵌入的模型预测进行比较。

**Result:** 研究发现，语义模型在解释人类判断时提供了补充信息。在这些语义模型中，基于动词的嵌入，从描述中提取，是对人类相似性判断解释最好的模型。

**Conclusion:** 这些结果表明，简单的动态显示中的社交感知反映了社交互动的语义结构，将视觉和抽象表示两者结合起来。

**Abstract:** Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

**Motivation:** 旨在解决现有方法在应对UAV姿态和视场引发的严重外观变化及建立可靠的全球场景级别语义和精细局部细节对应关系时遇到的关键挑战。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为EGS的新CVGL框架，以增强跨域泛化能力。具体来说，使用了E(2)-可转向CNN编码器来抽取稳定和可靠的特征，它能应对旋转和视点变化。此外，构建了一种带有虚拟超节点的图，该超节点连接所有局部节点，使全局语义得以聚合并重新分布到局部区域，从而强制全局局部一致性。

**Result:** 在University-1652和SUES-200基准测试上，EGS展示了一致的显著性能提升，建立了跨域CVGL的新标准。

**Conclusion:** 新提出的EGS框架通过引入E(2)-可转向CNN和图中的虚拟超节点机制，显著提升了CVGL在跨视域和跨域环境下的性能。

**Abstract:** Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

**Motivation:** 红外小目标检测在遥感应用中非常重要，但由于背景复杂和噪声影响，小目标容易隐匿其中。现有的方法通常依赖固定的梯度算子或简单的注意力机制，无法准确提取边缘特征。

**Method:** 通过双路径网络，一种路径用于捕获多尺度的局部和全局特征依赖关系，另一种路径用于增强细粒度的边缘细节，结合了结构语义和边缘改进。

**Result:** 该方法能够有效结合结构语义和边缘细化，为红外小目标的精确检测和定位提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

**Conclusion:** 本文提出的双路径边缘网络有望解决复杂背景和噪音条件下红外小目标检测的难题，展示了在实际场景中的应用潜力。

**Abstract:** Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

**Conclusion:** 研究建立了群体意图预测未来研究的坚实基础。

**Abstract:** Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

**Motivation:** 现有的海事目标检测受到标注数据稀缺性和跨各种海事属性泛化性能差的限制。模型在开放海域等代表性不足的场景下表现不佳。

**Method:** 开发Neptune-X，这是一种数据驱动的生成选择框架，通过合成数据生成和任务相关的样本选择来提高训练有效性。具体来说，包括X-to-Maritime，一个多模态条件的生成模型，用于合成多样和真实的海事场景，以及一个关键组件，双向对象-水注意力模块，它捕捉对象和水体环境之间的边界交互，以提高视觉保真度。此外，提出了属性相关的主动采样，该方法根据任务相关性动态选择合成样本。

**Conclusion:** Neptune-X方法表明，通过合成数据生成和相关样本选择，可以提高海事场景合成的有效性，特别是在挑战性场景中的检测准确度。

**Abstract:** Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

**Motivation:** 该研究的动机是弥补现有的CBN在长时间月球测绘任务中的不足，特别是在稀疏、斜视角图像和各种光照条件下长时间的挑战。

**Method:** CBN（基于陨石坑的导航）方法的主要改进是STElla系统，它结合了基于Mask R-CNN的陨石坑检测器、描述符无关的陨石坑识别模块、鲁棒的透视-n-陨石坑姿态求解器和批处理轨道确定后端。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，STElla系统在不同的视角、光照条件和月球纬度下，平均可以保持米级的位置精度和亚度的姿态精度。

**Conclusion:** 该研究完成了第一项对真正的月球测绘环境下CBN方法的全面评估，并为未来任务的运行条件提供了参考。

**Abstract:** Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管现有研究表明，训练在不同模态上的深度视觉和语言模型在表征空间上部分对齐了输入，但仍不清楚这种对齐具体发生在网络的哪一部分、由哪些视觉或语言线索支持，以及这种对齐是否反映了人类在多种图像-文本场景中的偏好。特别是，聚合同一概念的样本对对齐的影响也不明确。

**Method:** 本研究通过系统性调查来探讨跨模态模型中的表征空间对齐问题，特别是检查对齐出现的位置、支持对齐的视觉或语言线索、以及模型是否捕捉到人类在多对多图像-文本场景中的偏好。研究纳入了中期到后期网络层的对齐情况，并使用了“Pick-a-Pic”任务来模拟人类对图像-描述匹配偏好的判断。

**Result:** 研究发现，网络层中期到后期的对齐情况最为显著，对齐与语义高度相关而不是仅靠外观变化。多个描述项与单一图像对应的双向场景实验证实模型捕捉到了精细的语义差别。同时，通过对同一概念的多个示例进行平均处理，反而加强了对齐效果。

**Conclusion:** 研究成果表明，单一模态的网络模型在中期到后期对齐到了共享的语义代码，这种对齐不仅反应了人类的判断偏好，而且随着示例的聚集与增强而加深。

**Abstract:** Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to overcome the existing limitations in image editing, particularly in achieving precise geometric control and style consistency when inserting objects into images. The existing methods are typically confined to 2D space and often lack the ability to maintain stylistic consistency.

**Method:** The method involves converting 2D objects into 3D for interactive editing, which introduces geometric controls such as shape and view. Diffusion adapters are used to handle style and content control, leading to final edited images that are both geometrically accurate and stylistically consistent.

**Result:** The framework was able to generate edited images that exhibit precise geometric control and stylistic consistency, effectively solving the problems of object insertion into scenes.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that the proposed FreeInsert framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing image editing methods by providing a geometrically controlled and style-consistent approach to object insertion, without requiring extensive training.

**Abstract:** Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

**Abstract:** Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

*Jincai Song,Haipeng Chen,Jun Qin,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

> The paper discusses a new method named dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) which addresses the challenges of cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG) in medical image segmentation, especially when there are domain shifts between the labeled and unlabeled training data, as well as between the training and testing sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address a more practical and challenging issue in SSDG, where domain shifts occur between the training and testing sets and also between the labeled and unlabeled training data. The existing methods often fail to perform well under these conditions due to inaccurate pseudolabels.

**Method:** Proposes a dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework, which uses two sub-models offering cross pseudo supervision, feature-level supervision, and asymmetric auxiliary tasks to tackle the issue of inaccurate pseudo-labels caused by domain shift in training data.

**Result:** The proposed DAC framework demonstrates robust generalizability across different real-world medical image segmentation datasets including Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM.

**Conclusion:** The DAC framework effectively improves the performance of domain generalization in medical image segmentation by addressing the inaccuracies of pseudolabels caused by domain shifts, thus increasing the robustness and generalizability of the model.

**Abstract:** Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

*Shihua Huang,Yongjie Hou,Longfei Liu,Xuanlong Yu,Xi Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

> DEIMv2通过引入DINOv3特征和优化轻量级模型设计，提供跨越不同设备的高性能和成本效益的检测模型。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** DEIM已经成为实时DETR的主要训练框架，其性能优于YOLO系列。DEIMv2旨在通过引入DINOv3特征和优化轻量级模型设计，提高性能与资源成本之间的平衡。

**Method:** DEIMv2利用DINOv3特征扩展了DEIM框架，并引入Spatial Tuning Adapter（STA）来将单尺度输出转换为多尺度特征。对于轻量级模型，使用HGNetv2并通过剪枝减少模型大小，以适应严格的资源限制。

**Result:** DEIMv2-X模型在50.3百万参数下达到了57.8 AP，超过其他X规模模型。DEIMv2-S在少于10百万参数的情况下，首次实现超过50 AP的成绩。即使是参数量仅为1.5百万的DEIMv2-Pico，也达到38.5 AP。

**Conclusion:** DEIMv2通过优化设计和轻量级模型优化，使得检测模型在不同资源预算下具有更高的性能，成为新的SOTA结果。

**Abstract:** Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against adversarial attacks while maintaining efficiency in task specialization.

**Method:** Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum DAC-LoRA, which integrates adversarial training into Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) by progressively challenging attacks.

**Result:** Substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.

**Conclusion:** The DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a standard PEFT pipeline, significantly enhancing robustness.

**Abstract:** Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

<details>

**Motivation:** 传统的参数微调在联邦学习中计算成本高，而现有基于prompt学习的方法表现出了参数少且高效的优势，但对于领域迁移的任务表现有限。

**Method:** prompt learning方法通过优化少量参数实现高效的下游任务适应，特别适用于联邦学习中，而现有的基于prompt学习的联邦领域泛化方法通常从训练样本中学得soft prompt。然而，这些学得的prompt多样性有限，并且容易忽略未知领域的信息。因此，我们提出了FedDSPG方法，通过引入领域特定的soft prompt并结合内容和领域知识生成模型，从而在推理阶段通过生成器获取未知领域的soft prompt，提高在未知领域的下游任务表现。

**Result:** 在多个公共数据集上的全面评估中，我们的方法在联邦领域泛化任务上超越了现有的强基线，达到了最先进的结果。

**Conclusion:** 通过引入领域特定的soft prompt并结合生成模型，我们的方法FedDSPG能够在未知领域中更好地指导下游任务，表现出色。

**Abstract:** Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

**Abstract:** Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class

*Yuxin Cao,Wei Song,Jingling Xue,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

> PoisonVID is a black-box poisoning attack on video large language models (VideoLLMs) using prompt-guided sampling. The attack successfully compromises the underlying sampling mechanism over three different models with high success rates, highlighting the need for improved security measures in VideoLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this research is to investigate and expose potential security vulnerabilities in prompt-guided sampling strategies in VideoLLMs, particularly since safety concerns regarding this method have been relatively unexplored.

**Method:** The paper introduces PoisonVID, a black-box poisoning attack on prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. It utilizes a closed-loop optimization strategy to iteratively optimize a universal perturbation that suppresses harmful frame relevance scores.

**Result:** PoisonVID achieves a high attack success rate ranging from 82% to 99%, demonstrating significant vulnerability in current prompt-guided sampling strategies across three different VideoLLMs.

**Conclusion:** The study underscores the need for more robust and secure prompt-guided sampling techniques to protect VideoLLMs against black-box poisoning attacks. Future advancements in sampling strategies are crucial to ensuring the safety and reliability of VideoLLMs.

**Abstract:** Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

**Motivation:** To overcome the challenges in balancing task-specific and distillation losses in quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD).

**Method:** Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances task-specific (TS) and knowledge distillation (KD) objectives using only two trainable parameters.

**Result:** Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy.

**Conclusion:** The proposed Game of Regularizer (GoR) improves the performance of small quantized models by reducing conflict between supervision signals and improving convergence. QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework, provides a robust solution for real-world deployment, even outperforming full-precision models under optimal conditions.

**Abstract:** Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

**Conclusion:** 虽然人类和机器识别系统与人类专家的准确性相比仍需改善，但此次挑战赛揭示了利用大规模网络数据集进行植物识别的潜力。

**Abstract:** The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究动力源自植物多样性和新品种快速育成的现实，这使得逐一建立特定物种的计数模型几近不可能。传统的基于视觉的方法使用特定的检测或回归模型来计数特定植物，本研究旨在重新思考植物计数问题的解决方案，从“计数什么植物”转变为“如何计数植物”。

**Method:** 该方法继承了TasselNet植物计数模型，使用了一个简单的视觉变压器并结合了多分支框感知本地计数器的创新点来提升跨尺度鲁棒性。通过融合本地计数的思想和类无关计数提取-匹配范式，模型能够实现跨物种计数。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，在两个有挑战性的数据集PAC-105和PAC-Somalia上，TasselNetV4不仅达到了较高的计数性能，还能高效运营。这证明了TasselNetV4在跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数上的显著效能。

**Conclusion:** 结论指出，TasselNetV4展现出了作为跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数视觉基础模型的潜力。此次研究提供了一种新的植物计数范式，通过创新方法克服了现有模型在植物计数上的不足。

**Abstract:** Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

**Conclusion:** 我们的结果证明了在半监督学习中使用解剖学约束对于准确、稳健和值得信赖的视网膜生物标记分割的潜力。

**Abstract:** Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the

**Conclusion:** SCRA-VQA 在两个具有挑战性的基于知识的VQA数据集OK-VQA和A-OKVQA上表现出色，准确性分别达到38.8%和34.6%。

**Abstract:** Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

*Jiabei Zhang,Qi Wang,Siyu Wu,Du Chen,Tianhe Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

> This paper investigates the correlation between perceptual optimization objectives and image quality assessment metrics and discovers an unanticipated asymmetry, as well as the impact of discriminator design on detail reconstruction during optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation of this study stems from the importance of perceptual optimization in generating visually realistic images and the lack of research clarifying the relationship between perceptual optimization objectives and image quality assessment metrics.

**Method:** The paper uses a systematic analysis to study the correlation between perceptual optimization objectives and image quality assessment metrics, with a focus on adversarial training and the impact of discriminator design.

**Result:** The study reveals an unexpected asymmetry between perceptual optimization and image quality assessment, showing that metrics effective in image quality assessment may not be suitable for perceptual optimization. Additionally, it was found that discriminator designs with patch-level and convolutional architectures are more effective for reconstructing detailed information during optimization.

**Conclusion:** The research highlights important insights into the design of loss functions and their relationship with the transferability of image quality assessment, contributing to the development of more systematic methods for perceptual optimization.

**Abstract:** Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled

**Abstract:** Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

> 本文提出了一种新的Nuclear Diffusion方法，该方法通过结合低秩结构和稀疏建模，并利用扩散后验采样技术来改进视频的分析和复原，特别在医学成像任务例如心脏超声去雾中取得良好效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文旨在解决视频序列中结构性噪声和背景干扰遮蔽动态内容的问题，这给准确的分析和复原带来了挑战。传统的方法如鲁棒主成分分析在处理这类数据时有所局限。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种结合低秩时序建模与扩散后验采样的混合框架，名为Nuclear Diffusion，旨在解决在视频分析和复原中遇到的结构噪声和背景干扰问题。这种方法超出了传统稀疏假设的局限，能够更好地适应实际视频数据中的丰富变化。

**Result:** 在医学成像问题如心脏超声去雾测试中，Nuclear Diffusion方法相较于传统RPCA方法在对比度增强（gCNR）和信号保持（KS统计量）方面有显著提升。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明结合基于模型的时序模型和深层正则化先验可以在视频保真度恢复上实现更好的效果，这对于视频复原任务具有重要意义。

**Abstract:** Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

**Abstract:** The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The main motivation is to improve the interpretability of models when dealing with video data by extending the concept bottleneck models (CBMs) that were successful with static images.

**Method:** MoTIF adapts the concept bottleneck framework for video classification by using a transformer-based model to handle sequences of arbitrary length and to explicitly enable three complementary perspectives: global concept importance, local concept relevance, and temporal dependencies.

**Result:** The results show that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively transferred to video data, providing better understanding of concept contributions in temporal contexts.

**Conclusion:** The introduction of MoTIF demonstrates the effectiveness of transferring the concept bottleneck framework to video data, enhancing interpretability through temporal context understanding while keeping up with performance standards.

**Abstract:** Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

> This paper explores the use of particle filters for 3D object localization from camera measurements, proving especially useful for tasks like drone-based wildfire monitoring where traditional approaches are not ideal due to distant objects or limited computing power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The main motivation is to achieve 3D object localisation for safety-critical tasks like drone-based wildfire monitoring, where conventional methods such as dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction are impractical due to the nature of the task or resource constraints.

**Method:** The paper proposes using particle filters for 3D object localisation from a sequence of camera measurements, applicable for both single and multiple target scenarios, particularly where dense depth estimation or 3D reconstruction are not feasible due to distant objects or limited computational resources.

**Result:** The proposed method was validated through 3D simulations and drone-based image segmentation sequences with GNSS-based camera pose estimates. The results demonstrated the feasibility of using particle filters for object localisation in these scenarios.

**Conclusion:** The study concluded that the particle filter method can efficiently handle localisation tasks based on camera poses and image segments even in situations where other methods are infeasible. It also highlighted the method's flexibility with regards to the detection method and its applicability to drone-based wildfire monitoring.

**Abstract:** 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 常规方法在处理计算病理学中极端的序列长度变化（从200到200K）时，通常在训练效率和优化之间妥协以保持其异质性。文章提出的方法旨在全面解决计算病理学中数据异质性和冗余性带来的挑战。

**Method:** 提出了一种基于打包的多示例学习（MIL）框架，该框架将多个采样的、长度可变的特征序列打包成固定长度的序列。这种方法可以在保持数据异质性的同时进行批量训练。此外，还引入了一个残差分支，该分支将来自多张幻灯片的废弃特征组合成超幻灯片，并用定制标签进行训练。这提供了多幻灯片的监督，同时减少了因采样造成的特点丢失。同时引入了一个基于注意力的下采样器，可以压缩两个分支中的特征，以减少冗余。

**Result:** 通过缓解这些挑战，该方法在PANDA(UNI)任务上实现了最多8%的准确性的提升，同时只需要常规方法12%的训练时间。

**Conclusion:** 这种方法突显了在计算病理学研究中，针对数据挑战进行集中减缓是具有重要潜力的。

**Abstract:** Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

**Motivation:** 为了生成适用于角色动画和虚拟现实的物理上合理的运动，并解决现有方法中模拟器所需计算成本高且无法并行化的问题。

**Method:** 我们将模拟器基础的运动投影解释为扩散过程中的某种形式的引导，基于这一洞见，我们提出了SimDiff——一种将环境参数直接融入到降噪过程中的模拟器约束扩散模型。这样做不仅消除了推理阶段对模拟器的反复调用，还能够精确控制不同的物理参数。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，SimDiff能够在生成物理逼真的运动时更高效，同时它也能很好地泛化到那些未见过的环境参数组合中，证明了组合泛化的成功。

**Conclusion:** 通过引入环境参数并将其融入到降噪过程中，SimDiff能够在不调用多次模拟器的情况下生成有效的物理运动，同时提供了对不同物理系数的精细控制。

**Abstract:** Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

**Motivation:** 研究的动机在于探讨视觉模型在面对添加的高斯噪声时为何会显示出不同的抗噪性，从而提出系统的、可执行的设计规则。

**Method:** 通过对1,174个预训练视觉模型进行广泛评估，确定了四种提高对高斯噪声抗性的设计模式：更大的初始卷积核、较小的输入分辨率、平均池化以及使用监督视觉转换器（ViTs）而不是CLIP ViTs。

**Result:** 这些设计模式可以导致排名提升多达506位，并且准确率提升高达21.6%。理论分析解释了这些发现，包括证明低通初始卷积核能够减少噪声，解释了平均池化如何在减少噪声的同时不会引入偏差。

**Conclusion:** 该研究将抗噪性拆解为几个可解释的模块，提出了一个理论解释了观察到的趋势，并构建了实际的、即插即用的设计指南来提升视觉模型的抗高斯噪声能力。

**Abstract:** While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

**Abstract:** Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for

review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new

**Conclusion:** The proposed system is capable of automatic defect detection and classification for laser power meter sensors, with potential for significant cost savings and fast processing.

**Abstract:** We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and

critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.
The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality
control and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device
implementation.

**Abstract:** The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial

(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a

aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to

Main category: cs.CV

> The paper introduces ASD, a method for deep image clustering utilizing SSL techniques without prerequisites, demonstrating superior performance to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation for this work is to address the limitations of existing methods that require pretraining or clustering learning for SSL integration in deep clustering frameworks, aiming to enable flexible and out-of-box applications.

**Method:** Specifically, the paper proposes ASD, an adaptor that facilitates the cold-start of SSL learners for deep image clustering. It starts by randomly sampling pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data and then employs an instance-level classifier to learn them using semantically aligned instance-level labels. Based on the instance-level classification ability, the method tracks the transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract high-level similarities, which are then used to assign cluster-level labels to the pseudo-labeled data. Finally, the paper triggers a general SSL learner trained on the unlabeled data for clustering, using the pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels.

**Result:** ASD shows superior performance on various benchmarks when compared to the latest deep image clustering approaches. It exhibits a very slight accuracy gap compared to SSL methods using ground-truth data, e.g., only a 1.33% accuracy gap on CIFAR-10.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion of the paper is that ASD effectively enables the cold-start of SSL learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites, leading to performances comparable to or surpassing those of existing methods. Additionally, it highlights the potential of ASD to further enhance existing SSL-embedded deep image clustering methods.

**Abstract:** Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 视觉变换模型作为视觉基础模型的骨干，会产生高范数缺陷，从而降低表示质量。现有方法试图去除这些缺陷但遇到了在抑制缺陷和保留有用信号之间权衡的问题。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种名为Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER) 的新型蒸馏框架，旨在在抑制特征缺陷的同时保留有用信息。其核心思想是在精炼训练过程中利用零空间指导扰动来保留信息并抑制缺陷。使用基于LoRA的适配器实现这一扰动，只需少量结构改动。

**Result:** 实验结果显示该方法可以改善学生模型，实现多个下游任务的最先进性能，并生产出更清晰、更可解释的表示。

**Conclusion:** 通过Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER) 方法进行蒸馏框架的开发，实现了抑制视觉变换器中的高范数缺陷并维持有用信息，有效提升学生模型的表现。

**Abstract:** Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

**Abstract:** Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth
observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor
configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose
Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

**Motivation:** 现有的解决方案是针对特定问题设计的，专注于某些植物种类或特定的传感器模式。通常使用大量的预处理步骤，对植物点云进行降采样以满足硬件或神经网络输入大小的要求。我们旨在提供一种轻量级的解决方案，保留分辨率，避免复杂的预处理和降采样。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，在不同的传感器模态和植物种类中，结合KDSS算法的分割模型能够提供令人满意的结果。

**Conclusion:** 结合KDSS与当前最先进的分割模型，我们在不同的模态（如摄影测量、激光三角测量和LiDAR）中对不同植物种类进行评估，结果显示了令人满意的结果。

**Abstract:** Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this work is to address the low robustness of existing FG-BG decomposition methods in FS-OOD detection, primarily caused by over-reliance on local class similarity and a fixed background patch extraction strategy.

**Method:** The proposed Mambo framework introduces a background prompt to obtain local background similarity that includes both background and semantic information. This is further refined using local class similarity. Additionally, a patch self-calibrated tuning method is introduced to handle sample diversity and flexibly select background patches.

**Result:** Experiments on real-world datasets show that Mambo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of OOD and near OOD detection performance.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that the proposed Mambo method enhances the performance of FS-OOD detection by overcoming the limitations of existing methods, achieving the best results on real-world datasets.

**Abstract:** Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation of this paper is to address the issue of unrepresentative test sets resulting from random splitting of datasets in image segmentation, which leads to biased evaluations and poor model generalization.

**Method:** Building on existing stratification concepts, the paper introduces Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS) and Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES). IPS is a label-aware sampling method for segmentation tasks. WDES is a genetic algorithm that minimizes the Wasserstein distance to optimize the similarity of label distributions across dataset splits.

**Result:** The results show that WDES consistently produces more representative dataset splits compared to random sampling. It leads to lower performance variance and improved model evaluation when applied to diverse segmentation tasks like street scenes, medical imaging, and satellite imagery.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that WDES, in particular, is effective in handling small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting strategies tend to introduce the most bias. This makes WDES a valuable tool for improving the reliability of model evaluation in image segmentation tasks.

**Abstract:** Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有细分分类模型主要依赖于边界框、部件位置或文本属性等部件标注来提高分类性能，或者使用复杂的注意力图自动提取技术。然而，这些基于部件的方法往往在表示局部特征方面存在不足，而局部特征对于区分相似物体非常关键。

**Method:** 本研究提出了EnGraf-Net模型，该模型利用结构化的语义关联（层次结构/分类学）作为监督信号，在端到端的深度神经网络中应用。这种方法无需使用裁剪技术或人工标注。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，EnGraf-Net在CIFAR-100、CUB-200-2011和FGVC-Aircraft这三个著名数据集上的性能优于许多现有的分类模型，并且达到了最新的先进方法的水平。

**Conclusion:** 通过结合分层结构的语义关联，EnGraf-Net模型证明了在不依赖于传统部件标注的情况下，可以实现具有竞争力的细粒度图像分类性能。

**Abstract:** Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

**Motivation:** 随着机器学习系统的广泛运用，其安全性问题变得尤为重要。特别是针对ViT在对抗性扰动方面虽然表现出较强的鲁棒性，但仍然存在逃避攻击的风险，尤其是对抗性补丁攻击。研究动机是调查这些漏洞，并评估对抗性技术的迁移可能性。

**Method:** 本研究使用了Creases Transformation (CT) 技术设计现实的对抗性补丁，以引起ViT在人物 vs 非人物分类任务中的误分类。此外，还评估了在CNN中使用的对抗样本攻击技术能否迁移到ViT分类模型中。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，在四个经过微调的ViT模型上的二元人物分类任务中，对抗攻击成功率从40.04%（google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k）到99.97%（facebook/dino-vitb16）不等，展现了在不同类型ViT模型上的不同脆弱性。

**Conclusion:** 研究证实了来自CNN的对抗性补丁可以迁移到ViT上，同时发现预训练数据集的规模和方法对模型对对抗性攻击的抵抗力影响较大。

**Abstract:** The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To develop a more precise and controllable method for video concept transfer that allows for fine-grained control over video components and enhances learning from large-scale unlabeled data.

**Method:** UniTransfer uses spatial decomposition into foreground, background, and motion flow components, employs a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture, employs a self-supervised pretraining strategy with random masking, and introduces a Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism for timestep control through large language models.

**Result:** The authors achieved high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across various inputs, yielding results that surpass baselines in terms of visual fidelity and editability.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method, UniTransfer, effectively supports precise and controllable video concept transfer, paving the way for advancements in this area with the introduction of the OpenAnimal dataset and novel mechanisms for video processing.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

**Motivation:** 现有的多模态大语言模型主要依靠静态感知阶段进行解析视觉分析，推理能力有限。VTTS旨在通过推理期间的迭代感知来改进多模态大语言模型的推理能力，以达到类似人类的感知和理解水平。

**Method:** VTTS采用迭代感知机制(ITP)，通过强化学习与时空监督来优化推理，并设计了专门用于迭代感知的VTTS-80K数据集。

**Conclusion:** VTTS的有效性和泛化能力得到实验证实，说明通过增加感知计算可以提升多模态大语言模型的性能。

**Abstract:** Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse

remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 理解深度学习模型的学习内容对于人工智能在临床环境中的安全应用至关重要。虽然先前的工作集中在基于像素的可解释性方法上，但是对于这些模型学习到的文本概念的关注较少，而这些概念可能更好地反映了临床医生的推理方式。

**Method:** 提出Mammo-CLIP Dissect，一种基于概念的解释性框架，用于系统地解剖用于乳腺摄影的深度学习视觉模型。通过使用特定于乳腺摄影的视觉语言模型（Mammo-CLIP）作为“解剖器”，该方法以人类可解释的文本概念标注指定层的神经元，并量化其与领域知识的对齐程度。

**Result:** 研究表明，使用乳腺摄影数据训练的模型能捕捉到更多具有临床相关性的概念，并且与放射科医生的工作流程对齐得更好，而未使用乳腺摄影数据训练的模型则不然。任务特定分类的微调增强了某些概念类别（例如良性钙化）的捕获，但可能会减少其他概念（例如密度相关特征）的覆盖范围，表明专业化和通用化之间存在权衡。

**Conclusion:** Mammo-CLIP Dissect为理解卷积神经网络如何捕获特定于乳腺摄影的知识提供了见解。通过在不同的训练数据和微调策略之间比较模型，揭示了领域特定训练和任务特定适应如何塑造概念学习模式。

**Abstract:** Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

**Motivation:** 解决现有模型在视频推理过程中存在过程不一致的问题，提高理解的连贯性和推理过程的稳定性。

**Method:** 提出了一种基于动态时间规整（DTW）过程奖励的强化学习框架MOSS-ChatV，以对齐推理过程与时间上的参考点。

**Result:** 在MOSS-Video测试集上MOSS-ChatV达到了87.2%的准确率，并在其他视频基准测试中也有良好表现，跨不同架构表现出广泛适用性。

**Conclusion:** MOSS-ChatV框架可以产生更一致和稳定的推理过程，通过对不同架构的评估证实了其广泛适用性。

**Abstract:** Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 生成由相机轨迹引导的视频在保持一致性和泛化能力方面面临重大挑战，尤其是在相机和物体同时运动的情况下。现有方法往往尝试分别学习这些运动，可能导致对相机和物体之间的相对运动产生混淆。

**Method:** 提出一种新颖的方法，该方法将相机和物体运动合并为对应像素的运动。 使用稳定的扩散网络，有效学习相对于指定相机轨迹的参考运动图。这些图，连同提取的语义物体先验，被输入到图像到视频的网络中，生成能够准确跟随指定相机轨迹并维持一致物体运动的视频。

**Result:** 广泛的实验验证了模型在很大程度上优于现有最佳方法。

**Conclusion:** 通过将相机与物体的运动转化为像素的运动，并借助稳定扩散网络生成运动参考图，该方法能够生成高质量且遵循指定相机轨迹的视频。

**Abstract:** Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The rapid progress of image generative AI and the need to understand under which conditions discriminators are most disadvantaged.

**Method:** We analyze the impact of data dimensionality and data complexity on the performance of discriminators in the context of image generative AI.

**Result:** Very simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic images; intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection.

**Conclusion:** Generators can almost perfectly learn simple datasets and extreme complexity masks imperfections, but intermediate-complexity datasets are most challenging for generators, leading to detectable errors.

**Abstract:** The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前的模型处理多分辨率任务时普遍存在灵活性不足的问题，作者希望通过引入自适应分辨率推理来优化这一现状。

**Method:** WAVECLIP使用多级小波分解来处理照片，并在推断时以低分辨率开始逐渐提升，仅在必要时增加信息。通过基于信心的门控机制来实现提前退出，提供了计算量和准确性的动态调整。

**Result:** WAVECLIP通过基于小波的标记化实现单一统一模型，适用于CLIP中的自适应分辨率推断。它通过多级小波分解替代标准的补丁嵌入，使模型能够从粗到细地逐步处理图片，并在单个模型中自然支持多种分辨率。推理时，模型从低分辨率标记开始，在需要时通过缓存键值和因果跨层注意力仅添加新信息来简化计算。我们在零样本分类中评估了WAVECLIP，结果表明，一种简单的基于信心的门控机制允许自适应提前退出，使用户能够动态选择计算量和准确率之间的权衡。我们的方法只需要从冻结的CLIP老师进行少量的提炼，并且在显著计算节省的情况下仍能达到具有竞争力的准确性。

**Conclusion:** WAVECLIP通过自适应分辨率处理实现了计算效率的提升，同时保持了较高的准确率，适用于多种任务需求。

**Abstract:** We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 改善计算效率和可靠部署CLIP模型，特别是在量化对模型性能影响的研究。

**Method:** 通过大规模评估量化对CLIP模型的影响，不仅关注内部数据准确性，还关注可靠性指标，揭示了由预训练源驱动的反直觉结果。

**Result:** 量化通常改善了典型低信心预训练模型的校准，而对高信心变种则往往降低校准。对于校准较差的模型，量化仍然可能提高OOD检测性能。特定的量化感知训练方法可以在零样本准确性、校准和OOD鲁棒性上同时获得收益。

**Conclusion:** 量化不仅仅能提高模型性能，还可以同时提高模型的可靠性和效率，这为部署可靠的视觉语言模型提供了新的视角。

**Abstract:** The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 作者指出现有的特征归因方法虽然广泛用于解释基于图像的预测，但其解释往往在鲁棒性上有所不同，有时无法忠实反映底层黑盒模型的推理过程。本文旨在克服这些限制。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种基于Conformal预测的新方法，旨在让用户能够直接控制生成解释的保真度。该方法通过识别一个足以保持模型预测的显著特征子集来工作，而无需访问用于校准的真值解释。为了量化解释遵循模型预测的程度，提出了四个符合性函数。

**Result:** 该方法在六个图像数据集上通过对五种解释器的实证评估证明了其有效性。结果显示，FastSHAP在保真度和信息效率方面均优于其他方法，后者通过解释区域的大小来衡量。此外，基于超像素的符合性度量比基于像素的度量更为有效。

**Conclusion:** 通过实证评估，作者证明了其方法在控制解释保真度和提高解释效率方面的有效性，特别是在基于超像素的符合性度量方面。

**Abstract:** Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决当前SLU方法面临的三大限制：1. 弱语义锚定；2. 局部细节和全局背景之间的不平衡；3. 跨模态学习效率低下。

**Method:** Sigma, 一个统一的基于骨架的SLU框架，包含：1. 一种注重手势的早期融合机制，促进视觉和文本模态之间的深度交互；2. 一种层次化的对齐学习策略，共同最大化不同模态配对特征之间的协议，有效捕捉细粒度细节和高级语义关系；3. 一种结合对比学习，文本匹配和语言模型的统一预训练框架，以促进语义的一致性和泛化能力。

**Result:** Sigma在多个跨不同手语和口语语言的基准测试中实现了最新的状态结果，包括孤立手语识别、连续手语识别和无词汇手语翻译。

**Conclusion:** 展示了语义丰富的预训练的影响和基于骨骼数据作为SLU独立解决方案的有效性。

**Abstract:** Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

Main category: cs.CV

> The paper introduces CARINOX, addressing the limitations of optimizing or exploring initial noise for aligning complex prompts with generated images in diffusion models, and showcases improvements on two benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To tackle the issue that current strategies alone can't effectively achieve compositional alignment in text-to-image diffusion models, the team introduces CARINOX.

**Method:** Recent methods focus on optimizing or exploring initial noise guided by reward functions that evaluate text-image alignment. However, optimization may get stuck due to initialization issues, and exploration can be impractical when needing a high number of samples. Reward metrics alone or in ad-hoc combinations fail to reliably score all compositional aspects.

**Result:** CARINOX raised average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in all major categories while maintaining image quality and diversity.

**Conclusion:** CARINOX unifies noise optimization and exploration with a structured reward selection, demonstrating superior performance across various compositional challenges in text-to-image diffusion models.

**Abstract:** Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 文本-图像生成技术虽迅速发展，但评估生成结果是否准确反映了描述对象、属性和关系仍然是一个核心挑战。由于当前评价主要依赖自动化指标，而这些指标并未经过充分验证。为了更好地理解这些指标在多大程度上能反映人类的偏好，本文开展了这项研究。

**Method:** 本文通过广泛的研究，分析了多种常用的文本-图像生成评价指标。研究不仅限于简单的相关性分析，而是深入考察了这些指标在不同组合问题上的表现，并将不同类型的评价指标与人类判断进行比较分析。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，没有单一的指标能在所有任务中保持一致的表现。指标表现会随组合问题的类型而变化。通过VQA（视觉问答）的指标虽然普遍使用，但并非总是最优。在某些特定情况下，基于嵌入的指标表现更好。单纯基于图像的指标贡献较小，因为它设计初衷是为了评估感知质量而不是对齐度。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现强调了谨慎选择评价指标的重要性，不仅为了实现可信赖的评价，也为了在生成模型中作为奖励模型。

**Abstract:** Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 计算病理学的进步越来越多地依赖于从全幻灯片图像(WSIs)中提取有意义的表示，以支持各种临床和生物学任务。这项研究的动机是开发一种可以同时捕捉局部和长程关系的通用深度学习框架，以提高WSIs的分析效果。

**Method:** 提出了一种将Mamba架构与图神经网络(GNNs)结合的深度学习框架，用于增强全幻灯片图像(WSIs)的分析。此方法旨在捕捉局部空间关系和长程上下文依赖性，提供了一种用于数字病理分析的灵活架构。Mamba模块在捕捉长程全局依赖性方面表现出色，而GNNs则强调精细的短程空间交互。为了有效结合这些互补的信号，提出了一种基于熵的信心加权机制的自适应融合策略，根据上下文的重要性动态平衡两个分支的贡献。

**Result:** 该研究展示了在预测基因融合和变异状态的任务中的方法有效性。所提出的框架SlideMamba，在精确召回曲线下的面积(PRAUC)上达到了0.751 ± 0.05的成绩，优于其他方法，如MIL (0.491 ± 0.042)和GNN-only (0.748 ± 0.091)。此外，在ROC AUC (0.738 ± 0.055)、敏感度 (0.662 ± 0.083)和特异性 (0.725 ± 0.094)方面也表现出竞争力。

**Conclusion:** 由这些结果来看，结合Mamba架构和GNNs的集成框架，特别是在加入了提出的基于熵的自适应融合策略之后，增强了其对空间解析预测模型任务的解决能力，表明了其在计算病理学应用中的潜力。

**Abstract:** Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管3D原生生成模型在游戏、电影和设计中的资产创建上取得了加速进展，但大多数方法仍然主要依赖图像或文本条件控制，缺乏细粒度、跨模态控制，这限制了它们的控制性和实际应用。为解决这一问题，引入了Hunyuan3D-Omni框架。

**Method:** Hunyuan3D-Omni是一个统一的框架，用于细粒度、可控制的3D资产生成。该模型超越了传统的图像或文本引导，能够接受点云、体素、边界框和骨骼姿态先验作为条件信号，实现对几何结构、拓扑结构和姿态的精确控制。所有信号在一个跨模态架构中被统一处理，而不是为每种模态设置单独的分支。模型通过逐级、难度感知的采样策略进行训练，这种策略针对每个样本选取一个控制模态，并增加对更难信号（如骨骼姿态）的采样权重，减少对更易信号（如点云）的采样权重，以促进多模态融合及缺失输入的优雅处理。

**Result:** 实验结果显示Hunyuan3D-Omni增加了生成的准确性，允许几何感知转换，提高了生产工作流的鲁棒性。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，框架提供的额外控制提升了生成精度，能够实现几何感知的转换，并增强了生产工作流的鲁棒性。

**Abstract:** Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

**Conclusion:** 结论部分表明，利用视觉-语言模型生成的语义注意力图能够有效地指导CNN的注意力机制，使得模型的决策更符合人类认知，并且无需依赖大量的手动标注，具有很好的泛化能力和可扩展性。

**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

**Motivation:** 该研究旨在克服MRI自动化分析中存在的复杂性和异质性的挑战，特别是在大规模和可推广的机器学习应用中。尽管基础模型在自然语言和视觉任务中取得了革命性进展，但它们在MRI上的应用仍然有限，这主要是由于数据稀缺和范围狭窄的解剖学焦点。

**Conclusion:** 结果表明，Decipher-MR在疾病分类、人口预测、解剖定位和跨模式检索等不同的基准测试中，均显示出对现有基础模型和任务特定方法的持续性能改进，确立了Decipher-MR作为MRI-based AI的可扩展和多功能基础。

**Abstract:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent
performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.
Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for
MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research
domains.

> This paper presents the SQ-InstructBLIP model, designed to enhance vision-language understanding by integrating image-aware sub-question generation for reasoning, overcoming the limitations of current LLMs in handling visual content and lack of transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind the study is to improve vision-language understanding systems that face challenges with multi-step reasoning, particularly in the handling of visual information and the lack of transparency in the internal mechanisms of currently used LLMs.

**Method:** Recent studies use LLMs to generate sub-questions and answers iteratively to address the multi-step reasoning problem. However, LLMs have limitations in handling fine-grained visual content and are opaque in their mechanisms. The SQ-InstructBLIP model improves upon this by integrating a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that generate image-aware sub-questions and answers, aiding in more accurate reasoning.

**Result:** Experiments with the SQ-InstructBLIP model demonstrated an improvement in reasoning accuracy when compared to previous approaches, especially when handling tasks that require interpretation of visual and textual information.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the SQ-InstructBLIP, by incorporating image-aware sub-question generation and using a structured approach for reasoning, outperforms traditional approaches in vision-language understanding tasks, particularly where multi-step reasoning is required.

**Abstract:** The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有评估主要集中在对齐上，检查提示中指定的元素是否出现，但忽视了模型在提示之外生成的内容。因此，需要为T2I模型中的幻觉现象提供一个明确的框架。

**Method:** 通过定义文本到图像(T2I)模型中的幻觉为偏见驱动的偏差，并提出一个包括属性、关系和对象幻觉三个类别的分类法来分析幻觉现象。

**Result:** 该框架为T2I模型的评估提供了一个上限，并揭示了隐藏的偏见，为T2I模型提供了更丰富的评估基础。

**Conclusion:** 这项研究为T2I模型中的幻觉现象提供了一个新的评估框架，强调了偏见的影响，并为未来的研究提供了基础。

**Abstract:** In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

> 本文提出了一种用于微动作识别的泛化模型，该模型通过分布鲁棒优化学习非个体特定表达，引入了时空对齐模块和群不变正则化损失机制，在大规模数据集中取得了优于现有方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的微动作识别方法在大规模的情景中往往表现不佳，主要是由于跨个体的变化性造成了相同的动作以不同的形式表现出来，影响了模型的健壮性及泛化能力。

**Method:** 我们的框架包含了两个可以在特征和损失层级别上运行的即插即用组件。在特征层面，时空对齐模块采用双分支设计，时间分支应用Wasserstein正则化对齐以稳定动态轨迹，频率分支引入基于方差的扰动来增强对抗个体特定频谱差异的鲁棒性。一致性驱动融合机制整合了两个分支。在损失层面，群不变正则化损失将样本划分成伪组来模拟未见的个体特定分布。通过加重边界案例并正则化子群差异，该损失函数促使模型泛化并超越简单的或频繁的样本，从而增强对困难变化的鲁棒性。

**Result:** 在大规模的MA-52数据集上的实验表明，我们的框架在准确性和鲁棒性上都超过了现有的方法，实现了在细微条件下的稳定泛化。

**Conclusion:** 该框架展示出卓越的性能和鲁棒性，特别是在处理微动作识别中由于个体差异引起的变化时表现出色，促进了该领域在心理评估和人机交互中的应用。

**Abstract:** Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

> 本文提出了一种语义匹配方法，通过改进VGGT模型以减少几何歧义和提高匹配可靠性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的语义匹配方法存在几何歧义和最近邻规则的限制，本文旨在通过引入具有几何感知像素描述符和整体密集对应机制的方法来解决这些问题。

**Method:** 利用VGGT模型，通过重用早期特征阶段，微调后期阶段，并添加语义头实现双向对应，来保留其固有优势。同时，通过循环一致训练策略、合成数据增强和渐进式训练方案减少混叠伪影，使VGGT适应语义匹配场景，特别是在数据稀少的情况下。

**Result:** 实验表明，提出的方法在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保存方面优于之前的基线方法。

**Conclusion:** 所提出的方法能够有效地解决语义匹配中的几何歧义问题，提高像素级别对应关系的准确性和可靠性。

**Abstract:** Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

> MedVSR is a new framework for medical video super-resolution that provides better alignment and reduced artifacts compared to current models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the challenge of obtaining high-resolution medical videos and the issues with existing super-resolution models, such as alignment errors, optical flow difficulties, and the introduction of artifacts.

**Method:** Content introduces a new framework called MedVSR aimed at video super-resolution for medical videos. It uses CSSP for improved alignment and ISSR for reducing artifacts and enhancing tissue structures.

**Result:** Experiments across four datasets demonstrate that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in reconstruction performance and efficiency.

**Conclusion:** MedVSR provides a promising solution for improving the quality of low-resolution medical videos, leading to better diagnostic capabilities.

**Abstract:** High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

**Motivation:** 大型多模态推理模型的发展受限于高质量长链推理数据的缺乏和强化学习算法在后期训练中的不稳定。现有的Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)框架在奖励变异低时容易出现梯度消失问题，从而削弱优化信号和影响收敛。

**Result:** {_hidden}

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明，所提出的VAS策略和精心策划的数据集在数学推理基准上的有效性得到了验证。此外，研究理论证明了奖励变异性的下限是期望策略梯度大小，VAS提供了一种实用的实现手段。


**Abstract:** Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

**Motivation:** AI基础模型（FMs），利用大规模未标注数据集预训练，有可能改变海洋科学中的AI应用，特别是当标注数据相对稀少且收集成本高昂时。

**Method:** 使用Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构预训练的基础模型，该模型旨在重构Sentinel-3 OLCI的数据，然后在两个下游海洋遥感任务中进行微调评估。

**Result:** 模型表现优于当前用于量化叶绿素浓度的基准模型，并能改进基于遥感的海洋初级生产力估计。结果表明，自训练的FMs在利用少量高质量标签数据和捕捉海洋颜色的详细空间模式方面具有有效性。

**Conclusion:** 新一代的地理空间AI模型有可能提供更强大、数据驱动的见解，用于理解和分析海洋生态系统及其在全球气候过程中的作用。

**Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

**Conclusion:** SHINE 证明了不依赖于潜在反转或其他冗余框架的图像合成的有效性和优越性能，并且新引入的 ComplexCompo 数据集为未来的研究提供了严格和挑战性的基准。

**Abstract:** Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).

**Motivation:** 视觉几何基础变换器（VGGTs）因其庞大的计算和内存成本阻碍了其在实际部署中的应用。该论文旨在解决大规模VGGTs的量化问题，特别是在数据独立特殊标记引起的重尾激活分布和3D数据的多视角特性导致的校准样本选择不稳定等问题。

**Method:** 本文提出了针对VGGTs的第一个量化框架QuantVGGT。该框架有两个关键技术贡献：一是引入了双重平滑细粒度量化，整合了预全局哈达玛旋转和后局部通道平滑，以减轻重尾分布和通道间方差带来的问题；二是设计了噪声过滤多样化采样方法，通过深度层统计过滤异常值，并构造帧感知多样化校准簇以确保量化范围的稳定性。

**Result:** 广泛的实验表明，QuantVGGT在不同的基准测试和不同比特位宽下都实现了最先进的结果，超越了先前的泛化量化方法。特别地，4位的QuantVGGT可以实现3.7倍的内存减少和2.5倍的速度提升，并且在实硬件推理中保持高于全精度模型98%的重建精度。

**Conclusion:** 本研究证明了QuantVGGT在资源受限场景中的优势和实用价值。代码已公开发布。

**Abstract:** Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

**Method:** NewtonGen, 一个结合数据驱动合成和可学习物理原理的框架，其中核心是可训练的神经牛顿动力学（NND），能够模拟和预测多种牛顿运动，从而在视频生成过程中注入潜在的动态约束。

**Result:** NewtonGen 能够实现物理上一致的视频合成，并且提供了对生成过程的精确参数控制。

**Conclusion:** NewtonGen 通过结合数据先验和动态引导，克服了现有模型在生成视频时物理一致性不足和参数不可控的问题。

**Abstract:** A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

**Abstract:** We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step

gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder

configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
