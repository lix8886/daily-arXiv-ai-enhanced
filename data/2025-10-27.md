Main category: cs.CL

> 研究通过在Battleship游戏和Guess Who游戏中基准测试和发展语言模型代理的信息收集策略，实现了在资源有限的条件下显著提升AI的合理性和性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 许多高风险的应用中，人工智能（AI）需要根据数据提出假设和进行有目的的猜测，例如在科学、诊断领域。该研究旨在评估在资源有限的情形下，基于语言模型的代理在信息搜集方面能展现出怎样的合理性。

**Method:** 我们开发了一种策略决策导向的对话任务，名为协作式的Battleship游戏。在这个游戏中，一部分知情的船长需要平衡探索（提问）和行动（发起攻击），而完全知情的观察员必须在信息瓶颈下提供准确的答案。为了弥补语言模型在任务中的不足，我们基于贝叶斯实验设计（BED）的原则，为语言模型发展了新的蒙特卡洛推断策略。

**Result:** 对于观察员角色的代理，我们的方法将准确性提高了最多14.7%的绝对值；对于船长角色，实现了预期信息收益提高最多0.227比特。综合这些组件，提高了目标定位准确性，并使得较弱的语言模型在大约GPT-5成本的1%下，击败了人类和其他先进的模型。我们还在Guess Who游戏中验证了这些改进措施，显著提高了准确性。

**Conclusion:** 我们的方法提升了语言模型代理的信息搜集策略，特别是在资源有限的情况下，提高了这些代理在策略决策、信息收集游戏中的表现。这些改进也展示了这些方法的广泛适用性，能够构建更理性的信息寻求代理。

**Abstract:** Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

### [2] [Code-enabled language models can outperform reasoning models on diverse tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20909)
*Cedegao E. Zhang,Cédric Colas,Gabriel Poesia,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究指出，通过CodeAdapt方法，标准语言模型在进行推理时可达到或优于专门的推理模型，且更加高效。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管推理模型（RMs）效果显著，但训练和运行成本高昂。本研究旨在证明，标准指令型语言模型（LMs）可以直接以类似或超越RMs的表现进行推理，同时减少资源消耗。

**Method:** 通过结合使用CodeAdapt方法（结合CodeAct框架和少量示例引导的上下文学习），标准指令型语言模型（LMs）能够在无需微调的情况下达到与推理模型（RMs）相当或更优的推理能力，尤其是在多种领域如指令跟随、创意生成和数学推理上。

**Result:** 研究表明，使用CodeAdapt方法的三个LMs在平均情况下比对应的RMs在八项任务上更好（最多提高22.9%），且在四款模型上六项任务情况下的平均性能更佳（最多提高35.7%）。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果支持以下结论：（1）CodeAdapt式学习和推理可能是稳健且跨领域通用的；（2）代码增强的LMs是认知基础强大的系统，可能为权重内强化学习提供坚实基础。

**Abstract:** Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

### [3] [FicSim: A Dataset for Multi-Faceted Semantic Similarity in Long-Form Fiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20926)
*Natasha Johnson,Amanda Bertsch,Maria-Emil Deal,Emma Strubell*

Main category: cs.CL

> 构建并发布了FICSIM数据集，用于评估长文本语言模型在计算文学研究中的实用性，发现模型更侧重表面特征而非深层语义。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于长文本细粒度标注的成本高以及使用公共领域文学带来的数据污染问题，使得评估这些语言模型在计算文学研究中的实用性变得具有挑战性。现有的嵌入相似性数据集由于侧重于粗粒度相似性和短文本，不适合用于文学领域任务的评估。

**Method:** 构建了FICSIM数据集，该数据集包括长篇幅、近期创作的虚构作品，并以作者元数据和数字人文学者验证的12个相似性轴评分。评价了一系列嵌入模型在识别语义类别而非表面特征上的表现。

**Result:** 结果显示，多种模型倾向于强调表面特征而非对计算文学研究有用的语义类别。

**Conclusion:** 长文本语言模型在计算文学研究任务中的有效性需要进一步提升，特别是在捕捉文本深层语义方面。

**Abstract:** As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

### [4] [Do LLMs Truly Understand When a Precedent Is Overruled?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20941)
*Li Zhang,Jaromir Savelka,Kevin Ashley*

Main category: cs.CL

> 该研究评估了大型语言模型在识别美国最高法院案例中的推翻关系上的表现，揭示了模型在处理历史案例、深度法律理解和复杂任务中的依赖上下文推理方面存在三个关键限制。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究旨在评估大型语言模型在处理长法律文件上的能力，特别是在识别推翻关系这种复杂的法律推理任务上的表现。

**Method:** 使用包含236个案例对的数据集对最先进的大型语言模型进行了评估，以确定模型在识别推翻关系方面的表现。

**Result:** 评估显示，模型在处理历史案例时表现较差，依赖浅层逻辑启发式而不是深度法律理解，并且在复杂任务中产生时间上不可能的关系。

**Conclusion:** 该研究提供了一个基准测试，填补了真实场景下长上下文评估的空白，并模拟了实际法律推理任务的复杂性和风险。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

> 提出Irish-BLiMP，评估模型与人类在爱尔兰语的语法知识上的表现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 为了对爱尔兰语这一濒危语言的语用能力进行细粒度评估，本研究构建了第一个数据集和框架Irish-BLiMP。

**Method:** 通过参考各种语言学文献和语法规则手册，我们手动构建并审核了1020个最小对，这些最小对是通过一支流利的爱尔兰语讲者团队在11个语言特征的分类下创建的。

**Result:** 人类参与者在所有的语言特征上都超过了所有模型的性能，平均准确率高出16.6%；开源和闭源大语言模型之间存在显著的性能差距，相差18.1%。

**Conclusion:** 总体而言，Irish-BLiMP提供了第一个系统框架，用于评估LLM在爱尔兰语上的语用能力，并为低资源语言的语用理解研究提供了一个宝贵的基准。

**Abstract:** We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

### [6] [Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-thought is Necessary for Llms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007)
*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究探讨了信心门控链式思考（CoT）的有效性，并评估了几种不依赖训练的信心估计方法来决定何时使用CoT，发现这些方法可以减少不必要的CoT并优于随机CoT。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决CoT在某些任务上可能提高性能而在另一些任务上却没有帮助甚至降低性能的问题，并探讨如何在不需要额外训练的情况下更有效地应用CoT。

**Method:** 提出了通过信心门控链式思考（CoT）来解决何时使用CoT的问题，特别是提出了不依赖训练的信心估计方法来决定是否进行CoT。评估了四种不依赖训练的信心估计方法，并将这些方法与随机基线和全知基线进行了比较。

**Result:** 研究显示现有的不依赖训练的信心估计方法可以减少不必要的CoT使用，优于随机生成的CoT，并指出单个信心指标的效用不一致，这取决于数据集和模型。

**Conclusion:** 研究强调了当前信心估计方法的潜力和局限，并为更加可靠和自适应的CoT门控系统奠定了基础。

**Abstract:** Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

Main category: cs.CL

> 输入结构显著影响LLM生成体育报道摘要的准确性，使用JSON格式输入可大幅减少错误率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究动机在于评估不同输入结构对LLM在体育报道等准确性关键领域生成摘要时的影响，以提高其精准度和可信度。

**Method:** 研究方法涉及使用Llama-3.1-70B和Qwen2.5-72B模型，对NBA比赛数据进行三种格式（行结构、JSON和无结构）的处理，并手动标注了3,312个错误。

**Result:** 研究表明，输入结构对LLM生成摘要中的错误率有重大影响。相较于无结构输入，JSON输入可以显著减少错误率。统计分析表明，输入结构解释了超过80%的错误率差异。

**Conclusion:** 结论指出，JSON格式输入显著减少了Llama和Qwen模型的错误率，同时，实验结果通过两种统计分析方法验证了输入结构的显著性。

**Abstract:** A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as
sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the
input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other
factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across
three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated
3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models,
Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input
reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured
input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for
Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for
over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests
confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

> 研究发现，启用推理虽然能提高整体准确率，但在低假正率条件下（对很多任务非常重要），禁用推理反而表现更好。基于令牌的评分在精确度需求高的部署中更为有效。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管推理能够提升大型语言模型在多个基准测试中的准确率，但其在精度敏感任务中的适用性尚不明确。本研究旨在填补这一空白，探讨推理技术在低假正率条件下的表现。

**Method:** 我们的研究首次系统性地探讨了大语言模型和大型推理模型在严格低假正率要求下的分类任务表现。研究涵盖安全检测和幻觉检测两个任务，并在微调设置和零样本设置下进行了评估。

**Result:** 研究结果显示，启用推理生成在总体上提高了准确率，但是在低假正率条件下表现不佳。相比之下，禁用推理在高精度需求情况下表现更好。基于令牌的评分方法优于自我表述的信心评分。最后，两种模式的简单集成可以恢复各自的优势。

**Conclusion:** 推理作为一个双刃剑，在提升平均准确率方面有积极作用，但在需要严格精度的应用中往往不太适用。

**Abstract:** Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决黑盒API中静态演示集的选择问题，这些选择基于表面相似性导致的编辑质量与数量的权衡问题以及缺乏对任务难易度的适应性问题。

**Method:** 动态检索器用于情境知识编辑（DR-IKE），该轻量级框架通过奖励排名训练BERT检索器并采用可学习阈值修剪低价值示例，以适应任务难易程度。

**Result:** 在COUNTERFACT基准测试中，编辑成功率提高17.1%，减少延迟41.6%，且保持了无关查询的准确性。

**Conclusion:** DR-IKE展示了可扩展和适应的知识编辑能力，并且与黑盒大语言模型兼容。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

**Motivation:** 由于现有的问答系统性能主要集中在英语上，此研究致力于通过自适应RAG系统缩小语言间的差距，特别是针对印尼语。

**Method:** 自适应RAG系统结合分类器以区分问题的复杂性，从而决定回答问题的策略。为解决印尼语数据集不足的问题，研究采用了机器翻译作为数据增强方法。

**Result:** 实验显示可靠的问题复杂性分类器；然而，观察到在多检索回答策略中存在显著的不一致性，这在应用该策略时对整体评估产生了负面影响。

**Conclusion:** 研究强调了在低资源语言中问答系统的潜力与挑战，为未来改进提供了方向。

**Abstract:** Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

**Motivation:** 解决公共可用的电子健康记录数据稀缺问题，特别是非英语的EHR数据集，以促进智能药物推荐系统的开发。

**Method:** 创建了一个包含5,894个去标识记录的数据库，涉及3,190名患者，这些记录包含患者的人口统计学信息、病史、临床过程及出院诊断等。评估几种先进大语言模型在出院药物推荐任务上的表现。

**Result:** 实验结果显示监督微调能提升模型表现，但仍有提升空间，最佳模型F1分数为0.5648，Jaccard分数为0.4477。

**Conclusion:** 该结果突显了临床药物推荐任务的复杂性，确立了CDrugRed作为开发更强大和准确药物推荐系统的挑战性和有价值的资源的地位。

**Abstract:** Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决SFT方法在数据量较少的情况下过度拟合和域外泛化能力不足的问题。

**Method:** Self-Rewarding PPO, 结合SFT和PPO的方法，利用预训练模型和SFT模型之间的对数策略比值作为奖励信号，无需依赖人为偏好标注。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，Self-Rewarding PPO在多种自然语言处理任务上优于传统的SFT方法，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的情况下表现优异。

**Conclusion:** Self-Rewarding PPO是提高大型语言模型与示范数据对齐效果的有效方法，尤其适用于标注数据稀缺的情况。

**Abstract:** Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

*Qiang Ding,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

> Researchers introduce VeriGray, a new benchmark for assessing faithfulness in summarization by LLMs, revealing issues with existing models and annotation standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To improve the accuracy and reliability of large language models in generating faithful summaries, addressing an annotation ambiguity in current benchmarks regarding the use of external knowledge.

**Method:** A new annotation framework called Out-Dependent is introduced to categorize cases that involve external knowledge, leading to the creation of the VeriGray benchmark.

**Result:** Even leading models like GPT-5 show a non-negligible rate of hallucinations and a considerable amount of sentences requiring external knowledge verification, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty.

**Conclusion:** The research underscores the necessity for a more precise framework in evaluating the faithfulness of outputs from large language models, especially in summarization tasks.

**Abstract:** Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

**Motivation:** LLM虽然在自然语言处理中表现优异，但其黑盒性质限制了结构化和多步推理。TAG提供了明确的关系结构但也缺乏语义深度。结合两者可以互补，提升TAG的表示学习和LLM的推理及可解释性。

**Method:** LLM与TAG的结合从编排角度进行系统性回顾，分为两个基本方向：LLM用于TAG任务和TAG用于提升LLM的推理能力。编排策略分为顺序、并行和多模块框架，并讨论TAG专用预训练、提示和参数高效的微调方法。

**Conclusion:** 文章概括了开放挑战和未来的研究方向，旨在指引未来在语言和图学习交叉领域的工作。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 可靠的人类行为模拟对于解释、预测和干预我们的社会至关重要。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在模拟人类行为方面显现出潜力，但它们在社交环境中与真实人类行为的差异仍有待探索。这种差异可能会导致科学研究的误解和现实世界应用的意外后果。

**Method:** 通过模拟聊天室风格的多智能体互动，并从五个语言维度进行分析，本研究提出了一个系统框架来分析大型语言模型（LLMs）在社交模拟中的表现。

**Result:** 研究结果揭示了LLMs不能真实还原人类行为，而是反映了过于理想化的人类行为，受到了社会可欲性偏差的影响。LLMs表现出社会角色偏差、首因效应和积极偏差，导致构造出的“乌托邦”社会缺乏真实人类互动的复杂性和多样性。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现呼吁需要开发更多基于社会的LLMs，以捕捉人类社交行为的多样性。

**Abstract:** Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

**Motivation:** 研究的动机是探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）和多智能体系统（MAS）对紧急医疗调度（EMD）过程的支持作用，以应对呼叫者的紧张情绪、信息模糊和认知负荷。

**Method:** 研究构建了一个临床分类法（涉及MIMIC-III中的32种主要投诉和6种呼叫者身份）和六阶段呼叫协议。研究使用这一框架开发了一个基于AutoGen的多智能体系统（MAS），其中包含呼叫者智能体和调度智能体。系统通过事实知识库来保证临床可能性并且缓和虚假信息的问题。

**Result:** 人类评估，具有显著的评估者共识（Gwe's AC1 > 0.70），提供了系统的高水平表现确认。它在调度效率和导向功效方面表现出色（如94%的案例中正确触发潜在其他代理，91%的案例提供了建议），且这两项都被医生高度评价。自动语言分析（情绪，可读性，礼貌）进一步支持了这些发现，在情感上表现出主要中立（73.7%为中立情绪；90.4%为中立情感），高度可读（Flesch 80.9），并且一直保持礼貌（60.0%礼貌；0%不礼貌）。

**Conclusion:** 研究得出结论：这个基于分类法的MAS能够高度真实地模拟多种临床可接受的调度场景。研究结果支持使用该系统进行调度员培训、协议评估，甚至作为现有实时决策支持的基础。这项工作为在急诊工作流程中安全地整合先进AI代理提供了途径。

**Abstract:** Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型虽然在自然语言生成上取得了显著进步，但仍存在重复和不连贯等奇怪行为。这凸显了传统评估指标的局限性，传统指标强调局部预测准确性但忽视了长程结构复杂性。

**Method:** 本文引入了相关维度这一分形几何度量方法，用以量化语言模型认知中的文本复杂性。这种方法捕捉语言的层级递归结构，将局部和全局属性统一到一个框架下。

**Result:** 通过广泛实验，本文展示了相关维度（1）揭示了预训练过程中的三个不同阶段；（2）反映了随上下文变化的复杂性；（3）表明了模型倾向于幻觉的程度；（4）可靠地检测到生成文本中的多种退化形式。方法在计算上高效，对量化模型（低至4位精度）鲁棒，并且在自回归架构（如Transformer和Mamba）中具有普遍适用性。

**Conclusion:** 相关维度是一种新颖的方法，能够提供关于LLM生成动态的新见解。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

> This paper introduces PBS-Attn, a method tailored to optimize the efficiency of large language models by improving block-level sparsity in self-attention, leading to superior performance in long-context prefilling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The primary motivation is to address the computational bottleneck of self-attention mechanisms in LLMs, which consume significant computational resources and are not fully utilized due to sparsity in the attention matrix.

**Method:** Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn) is introduced to optimize the computational efficiency of large language models (LLMs) in the context of long sequences by increasing block-level sparsity and reducing redundancy in attention computation.

**Result:** PBS-Attn demonstrates better model accuracy compared to existing block-sparse attention methods and achieves a speedup of up to 2.75 times during long-context prefilling.

**Conclusion:** PBS-Attn effectively enhances the efficiency of LLMs in terms of both computational speed and accuracy, marking an advancement in the optimization of self-attention mechanisms for long sequences.

**Abstract:** Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

> PARL是一种使用大型语言模型作为强化学习代理的方法，研究人员在三个标准RL任务上测试了该方法，结果显示它在简单环境中具有良好的性能，但在需要复杂数学操作和解码状态与动作的任务中表现不佳。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管大型语言模型已在零样本或少量样本设置下展示了其在自然语言表达任务中的高性能，并且这些任务通常被表述为监督或非监督问题，但对将大型语言模型用作强化学习环境中代理的研究较少。因此，研究人员关注结构化的、非语言性的推理，例如解释格子世界中的位置。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为PARL（基于提示的强化学习代理）的方法，该方法通过提示使用大型语言模型作为强化学习代理，而无需微调。PARL在提示中编码动作、状态和奖励，使模型能够通过试错交互进行学习。

**Result:** 研究人员对PARL的方法进行了评估，将其应用于三个标准的强化学习任务，这些任务并不完全依赖于自然语言。结果显示，PARL在简单的环境中可以匹敌或超过传统的强化学习代理，但其在需要复杂的数学操作或解码状态和动作的任务上表现出性能限制。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，大型语言模型通过PARL方法能够成功用于强化学习任务，特别是在简单的环境中显示出良好的性能。然而，这个方法在一些复杂任务中遇到了挑战，表明了未来的改进方向。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型在开放式问答任务中准确估计语义随机不确定性和知识不确定性的难度大，需要进行大量的生成以获取稳定的估计结果，这过程昂贵且费时。因此，本文的动机是降低样本复杂度，提供一个提高样本效率的方法。

**Method:** 该方法引入了一个多样性引导采样器，通过在模型的候选分布中加入一个由轻微微调的自然语言推断（NLI）模型产生的连续语义相似性处罚来实现，从而减少在解码过程中语义冗余的输出。此外，通过重要性重加权去偏和使用控制变量减少方差来提高不确定性估计的质量。

**Result:** 该论文提出了一种新的采样器，可以有效减少大型语言模型在开放式问答任务中的语义不确定性和提高样本效率。通过引入连续的语义相似性惩罚，该方法能够减少语义重复的输出，适用于自回归及掩码扩散模型。实验结果显示，该方法在多个问答基准数据集上表现优于或匹配基线方法，并且在相同样本数量下覆盖了更多的语义簇。该框架具有模块化特性，可以作为现成的工具来提高风险敏感模型部署中的不确定性估计能力。

**Conclusion:** 该采样器展示了在无需访问基础模型梯度的情况下充分提高不确定性估计质量的能力，并能够在保持或超越现有基线的性能同时，使用更少的样本数覆盖更多的语义簇。因此，该框架在风险敏感的模型部署中可作为一个即插即用的增强工具。

**Abstract:** Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

**Motivation:** 探索语言学研究中的打字紊乱现象及NLP模型对这一现象的鲁棒性背后的机制。

**Method:** 通过对British National Corpus的分析来量化在打字紊乱现象下的单词合并和模糊性，评估BERT区分这些合并形式的能力，并通过对比在干净文本和打字紊乱的维基百科文本上从零开始训练的BERT变体进行探测实验来研究这个问题。

**Result:** 结果显示，打乱字母顺序引起的性能下降比预期要小。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，英语中单词在经历打字紊乱后仍能保持较高质量的表示主要是由于经历打字紊乱合并的单词相对较少，且这些合并后的单词通常出现在容易区分的语境中。

**Abstract:** Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

**Motivation:** 虽然先前的工作如TripCraft和TravelPlanner促进了利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成个性化旅行计划，但现实中的旅行经常受到中断。因此，需要一个基准来评估LLM在这种情况下的性能。

**Method:** 构建了TripTide基准测试，评估LLMs在旅行中断情况下修订行程的能力。测试包括自动指标（意图保持、响应性和适应性）、LLM作为自动评估工具以及专家手动评估。

**Result:** 实验显示，LLMs在保持顺序一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，但在处理中断方面的能力随计划长度增加而下降，显示了LLMs的局限性。

**Conclusion:** TripTide为评估基于LLM的旅行规划在现实世界不确定情况下的适应性、个性化和韧性确立了基准。

**Abstract:** Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

**Motivation:** 研究动机在于解决实际应用中多轮互动与目前单轮强化学习训练之间的潜在不匹配问题。

**Method:** 本研究对比了传统的单轮训练和三种多轮训练策略，通过多轮与单轮推理任务的评估来探讨多轮训练对于大语言模型推理能力的重要性。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，在单一回合评估中，单轮训练模型表现良好，而多轮策略训练模型的推理性能显著下降，证明单轮训练对于具有完整信息的任务更有效。

**Conclusion:** 对于具有完整信息的任务而言，强大的单轮训练仍然是更有效和可靠的方法，而基于基本反馈的多轮训练提供的收益有限，甚至可能损害推理能力。

**Abstract:** The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

**Motivation:** 现有的许多瑞典基准测试套件都是基于美国为中心的基准翻译而成的，不适合检验特定于瑞典的知识。因此，研究团队制作了一个专注于瑞典相关人物和事件的数据集，从而更好地评估模型在瑞典语知识方面的表现。

**Method:** 本研究创建了一个专注于瑞典相关人物和事件的手动编写问答基准数据集。该数据集的灵感来源于一个受欢迎的广播节目，该节目涵盖文化、媒体以及瑞典的主要体育赛事，并包含了英语翻译。

**Result:** 使用该数据集进行测试表明，瑞典语覆盖较强的较小模型在回想瑞典相关事实方面表现与一个三倍大的多语言模型相当。另外，研究还发现，用瑞典语进行额外预训练通常会提高事实知识，但也会导致部分先前已知信息的遗忘。

**Conclusion:** 这些结果展示了该数据集作为工具在研究语言适应性和知识保留方面的能力，尤其是在多语言模型和语言适应性期间。

**Abstract:** Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管transformer模型彻底改变了NLP，但是许多形态丰富的语言在大规模预训练工作中仍然代表性不足。因此，本文提出了SindBERT以探索土耳其语NLP的新领域。

**Method:** 本文介绍了SindBERT，这是第一个基于RoBERTa的土耳其语大型预训练模型，它从零开始训练，使用了312GB的土耳其文本数据，包括mC4，OSCAR23和维基百科。

**Result:** 评估显示，SindBERT与其他土耳其语和多语言模型相比具有竞争力，在四个任务中的两个上表现最好，但没有表现出持续的缩放优势。这表明当前的土耳其语基准可能已经达到饱和。同时，较小但更精心挑选的数据如BERTurk表明，语料的质量和多样性可以超越纯粹的数据量。

**Conclusion:** SindBERT作为土耳其语NLP的公开资源和关于形态丰富语言缩放限制的经验案例，做出了贡献。它表明，尽管数据量增加，但语料库的组成质量在形态丰富的语言中仍起到核心作用。

**Abstract:** Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

**Motivation:** 虽然Transformer模型推动了自然语言处理的发展，但希伯来语缺乏大规模的RoBERTa编码器。现有的模型在语料库规模、词汇或训练深度方面有所限制。

**Method:** 基于RoBERTa的模型HalleluBERT，根据从零开始训练的大量希伯来语网络文本和维基百科数据，使用希伯来语言特有的字节级BPE词汇表进行训练。

**Conclusion:** HalleluBERT在命名实体识别和情感分类基准测试中优于单语和多语模型，并为希伯来语设定新的技术标准，突显了全面收敛的单语预训练的好处。

**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have advanced NLP, yet Hebrew still lacks a
large-scale RoBERTa encoder which is extensively trained. Existing models such

Wikipedia with a Hebrew-specific byte-level BPE vocabulary. Evaluated on NER
and sentiment classification benchmarks, HalleluBERT outperforms both
monolingual and multilingual baselines. HalleluBERT sets a new state of the art
for Hebrew and highlights the benefits of fully converged monolingual

**Motivation:** 视觉语言模型在医疗保健应用中表现出潜力，但其在人类活动识别任务中的应用较少。本文旨在解决评估这类模型的动力和挑战。

**Method:** 本文介绍了一个描述性字幕数据集，并提出了综合的评估方法来评估视觉语言模型在远程健康监控中人类活动识别任务的表现。

**Result:** 通过与现有顶尖深度学习模型的对比实验，结果显示视觉语言模型在准确性方面达到了可比的表现，甚至在某些情况下超越了传统方法。

**Conclusion:** 本文提供了强有力的基准测试，并为将视觉语言模型集成到智能医疗系统中开辟了新的可能性。

**Abstract:** As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统信息检索（IR）指标假设人类用户会依次检查文档，但这种假定与大语言模型（LLM）处理检索文档的方式不匹配。我们为了更好地预测检索增强生成（RAG）系统性能，提出了新的评估指标。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种基于效用的标注方案，该方案量化了相关片段的正面贡献和分心片段的负面影响，并在此基础上提出了UDCG（效用与干扰感知累积增益）这一指标，其采用了一个面向大语言模型的位置折扣，直接优化了与端到端答案准确性的关联。

**Result:** 在五种数据集和六种大语言模型上的实验表明，与传统指标相比，UDCG将相关性提高了多达36%。

**Conclusion:** 这项研究提供了一个至关重要的步骤，将IR评估与大语言模型消费者对齐，更可靠地评估RAG组件。

**Abstract:** Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

**Motivation:** 远程病人监控领域缺少良好的人机交互解决方案，而这项研究弥补了这一空白，推出了具有自主远程监控功能的REMONI系统。

**Method:** 通过收集和处理来自可穿戴设备和视频片段的数据，使用异常检测模块监控病人的健康状况，同时运用大规模语言模型处理病人的情绪和活动识别。

**Result:** 实验显示系统可以在实际中实施和扩展，有助于减轻医护人员的工作负担和降低医疗成本。

**Conclusion:** 开发了一个原型系统来展示其功能，表现出了系统的强大能力和未来应用潜力。

**Abstract:** With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

> 本文提出了一种多奖励优化（MRO）方法，以通过强化令牌相关性来提升扩散语言模型（DLMs）的推理性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于扩散语言模型（DLMs）在推理性能方面落后于传统的自回归大语言模型（LLMs），特别是随着去噪步骤数量的减少。这种不足主要源于跨去噪步骤独立生成被掩码令牌，未能捕捉令牌相关性。

**Method:** 提出了一种多奖励优化（MRO）方法，该方法利用测试时间缩放、拒绝采样和强化学习来直接优化令牌相关性，并引入了组步和重要性采样策略来减少奖励方差，提高采样效率。

**Result:** 通过广泛的实验，MRO不仅提高了推理性能，还在推理基准测试中保持了高性能的同时实现了显著的采样加速。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，通过优化令牌相关性可以改进扩散语言模型的推理能力，并且通过引入组步和重要性采样策略可以实现采样效率和推理性能的双重提升。

**Abstract:** Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

**Motivation:** 现有的估计和改善与人类大脑反应对齐的方法依赖于参与者且受制于每个参与者数据量的大小，阻碍了对新参与者以及人口级别的分析。

**Method:** 引入了一种可扩展且具有一般性的脑部微调方法，对预训练的语音语言模型进行微调，使其能够同时预测来自多个参与者的fMRI反应。

**Result:** 实现了一种可以减少预测新参与者的大脑数据所需的fMRI数据量五倍，整体大脑对齐提高了最多50%，并且对新的未见过的数据集表现出强大的泛化能力的脑调谐模型。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果显示了一种在神经科学和人工智能之间双向互利的好处，有助于缩小两个领域的差距。

**Abstract:** Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available

**Motivation:** 研究的动机是调查RAG幻觉的机制，并发现它们在后期FFN模块中过量注入参数知识到残差流中时产生，这需要区分开外部上下文和参数知识的影响，以准确检测幻觉。

**Method:** 我们通过计算跨层和注意力头的外部上下文分数和参数知识分数，并训练回归分类器来预测幻觉。

**Result:** 方法对于最先进的大语言模型（LLM）进行了评估，并展示了在GPT-4.1-mini响应上的泛化能力。

**Conclusion:** 我们的研究结果强调了机制信号作为RAG系统中幻觉检测的高效且具有泛化能力的预测因素。

**Abstract:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination
detection in RAG systems.

**Conclusion:** 通过开发范畴理论的多模态文档结构，实现了一系列新的信息处理和文本生成技术，证明了这种方法的有效性，并为进一步的研究开辟了道路。

**Abstract:** We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

**Motivation:** 尽管大型语言模型在多语种行为上表现出显著差异，但语言的谱系结构在塑造这种差异中的作用尚未被充分探索。

**Method:** 通过扩展MultiQ数据集上的先前分析，研究大型语言模型（LLMs）是否表现出对语言分类的敏感性。首先检查模型是否倾向于切换到与其提示语言同源的语言，当保持语言忠实性受到挑战时。其次，探讨在同一分类内知识一致性是否优于跨分类的一致性。

**Result:** 研究发现分类水平的影响存在，但强烈依赖于训练资源的可用性。还观察到不同LLMs家族存在不同的多语种策略。

**Conclusion:** LLMs编码了一些分类水平的结构，但训练数据不平衡仍然是影响其多语种性能的主要因素。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

**Motivation:** 随着大语言模型能力的提升，需要更具有挑战性的评估来超越表面语言能力的评测，涵盖语用能力，即理解由情境、语言和文化规范塑造的意义。

**Method:** 引入了SloPragEval和SloPragMega，这是首个针对斯洛文尼亚语的语用理解基准测试，总共包含405个多选题。

**Result:** 结果显示，现有的大型语言模型在理解复杂的语言用法上有所进步，但依然存在挑战，特别是对特定文化语境下的非字面意义理解。同时，发现专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著性能差异。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明现有模型在理解细微语言方面有了很大改进，但可能仍然无法准确推断特定文化背景下的非字面含义，同时也发现了专有模型与开源模型之间存在显著差距。因此，强调针对目标文化的细微语言理解基准设计需谨慎，最好基于本地数据并用人进行验证。

**Abstract:** Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

**Motivation:** 词汇数据收集在语言文档中经常包含转写错误和未记录的借词，这些可能误导语言分析。为此，本文提出了识别词表中音系不一致的方法。

**Method:** 本文采用了无监督异常检测方法来识别词汇表中的音系不一致，使用字符级和音节级音系特征，以识别潜在的转写错误和借词。

**Result:** 尽管由于这些异常的微妙性质，精确度和召回率仍然相对较低，但音节感知特征显著优于字符级基准。

**Conclusion:** 这种高召回率的方法为领域工作者提供了一种系统的方法来标记需要验证的条目，支持低资源语言文档数据质量的改进。

**Abstract:** Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型(LLMs)在数学和编程任务中表现出卓越的推理能力，但在金融任务，特别是股票走势预测上的应用尚未得到充分探索。

**Method:** 本文提出了名为Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning)的方法，作为一种冷启动技术，在生成CoT时鼓励从多个信息来源动态构建分析框架，基于该框架组织和评分证据，以独立逻辑推理为基础进行预测，减少上下文观点的影响。

**Conclusion:** 通过RETuning技术，模型能够减少对分析员观点的依赖，提高独立逻辑推理能力，从而增强股票走势预测的准确性和可靠性。

**Abstract:** Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

**Result:** IF-Track方法首次成功地在一个单一的度量空间内建模了普遍的人类推理行为，并捕捉了推理的核心特征，识别系统性错误模式并刻画个体差异。

**Conclusion:** 该方法建立了理论与测量之间的定量桥梁，提供了关于推理架构的机制性见解，并首次通过IF-Track将单一过程理论与双重过程理论统一起来，发现人工智能与人类认知的一致性，并探讨大型语言模型如何重塑人类推理过程。

**Abstract:** Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

> 通过将干扰因素导向辅助模块，去除适配器学习不必要属性的动机，从而改善个性化和风格化文本到图像合成的质量和效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决适配器训练中存在的因输入图像混合多种视觉因素引起的不必要属性纠缠问题，这限制了生成模型的泛化能力和遵循输入文本提示的能力。

**Method:** 通过将干扰因素导向辅助模块（如ControlNet或LoRA）的方法来解决适配器训练中的干扰问题，从而去除适配器学习这些不必要因素的动机。辅助模块在推理阶段会被移除。

**Result:** 该方法提高了面部和全身身份插入等任务中的生成质量、多样性和输入文本提示的遵守程度。

**Conclusion:** 这些结果揭示了一个在大型模型时代中的通用设计原则：当寻求解耦的表示时，最有效的路径可能是为不应当学习的内容建立捷径。

**Abstract:** Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

> VAP通过将问题重新定义为上下文生成，并利用参考视频作为直接的语义提示引导模型，解决了现有视频生成方法中的关键挑战。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的视频生成方法要么通过施加不适当的基于结构的像素级先验来引入伪影，要么依赖于非通用化的条件特定微调或任务特定的架构。因此，需要一个统一且可泛化的语义控制方法。

**Method:** VAP利用参考视频作为直接的语义提示，通过一个即插即用的变换器专家（MoT）引导着冻结的视频扩散变换器（DiT）。这种方法消除了灾难性遗忘，并使用了带有时序偏置的位置编码来消除不正确的映射先验。

**Result:** 作为单一的统一模型，VAP为开源方法设定了新的最先进的水平，在用户偏好评估中获得了38.7%的评分，这与领先的商业条件特定模型相当。

**Conclusion:** VAP强大的零样本泛化能力及其支持各种下游应用的能力标志著向通用可控视频生成迈出了重要一步。

**Abstract:** Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

> This paper introduces FM-BFF-Net for medical image segmentation, successfully combining CNNs and transformers with innovative mechanisms for better global context understanding and precise boundary detection compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to overcome the limitations of convolutional neural networks in capturing global context and long-range dependencies, which affects their ability to segment structures with complex borders and varying sizes effectively.

**Method:** The paper proposes the FM-BFF-Net, a network that integrates convolutional and transformer components for medical image segmentation. It uses a focal modulation attention mechanism and a bidirectional feature fusion module to enhance context awareness and interaction across scales.

**Result:** Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate that the FM-BFF-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Jaccard index and Dice coefficient, indicating improved boundary precision and robustness to variations in lesion characteristics.

**Conclusion:** The proposed FM-BFF-Net showcases its ability to provide enhanced medical image segmentation, offering greater adaptability across different medical imaging scenarios by improving upon traditional CNN limitations.

**Abstract:** Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

> GenPT是一个用于点轨迹多模态建模的生成框架，它能捕捉到多模态，提高遮挡点的跟踪精度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 目前最先进的判别模型能够对长期点轨迹进行回归估计，但它们仅限于在不确定性存在时回归到均值（或模式），并且无法捕获多模态。为了克服这个限制，提出了本方法。

**Method:** 提出了名为GenPT的生成式框架，用于建模多模态轨迹。GenPT使用一种新颖的流匹配公式进行训练，该公式结合了判别追踪器的迭代细化、窗口相关的先验以及专门针对点坐标调优的方差计划。

**Result:** 在标准的PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准上对GenPT进行了评估，并且引入了TAP-Vid变体以评估被遮挡的点跟踪性能。实践证明，GenPT在被遮挡的点上获得了最先进的跟踪精度，同时在可见点上保持了与现有判别点跟踪器的竞争力。

**Conclusion:** GenPT展现了在遮挡和非遮挡条件下追踪点轨迹的能力，证明了它在追踪遮挡点方面处于领先地位，同时在可见点上提供有竞争力的追踪准确度。

**Abstract:** Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 针对当前视觉语言模型在3D医学图像解剖区域的定位和逐步推理能力不足的问题，该论文提出了一个新的数据集，旨在支持“有依据的推理”能力，并建立一个可供机器学习的高级基准。

**Method:** 介绍了一种新型的3D医学图像数据集3DReasonKnee，它包含了高清晰度的五元组数据，每个五元组包括3D MRI体积、针对特定解剖区域的诊断问题、定位相关解剖结构的3D边界框、医务人员生成的诊断推理步骤和相关解剖区域的结构化严重程度评估。

**Result:** 通过采用ReasonKnee-Bench评估基准，基准测试了五种最先进的VLMs的性能，展示了其在定位和诊断准确度上的基准表现，为未来的研究提供了基础。

**Conclusion:** 3DReasonKnee数据集作为关节外科医生诊断专业知识的仓库，可以极大地推动多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐、局部决策能力的发展。

**Abstract:** Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current state-of-the-art methods that are affected by ambiguities in visible polarization analyses and dependencies on illumination and material properties.

**Method:** The paper proposes a method for 3D shape reconstruction using thermal polarization cues from long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric images, which is independent of illumination and material properties.

**Result:** Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively reconstruct fine details in transparent, translucent, and heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion drawn is that the use of thermal polarization cues for 3D shape reconstruction provides a more robust solution, capable of handling various types of objects with finer detail.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenge faced by vision foundation models in underperforming in areas with distribution shifts and scarce labels, especially since supervised fine-tuning is not feasible in these cases. The proposed approach provides an alternative to continued self-supervised learning, which hasn't proven effective for vision-centric encoder models.

**Method:** Our method, referred to as VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual foundation models, is designed to adapt vision foundation models to a new domain without annotations, using only short multi-view object-centric videos. VESSA uses a self-distillation training technique, with careful tuning of prediction heads and deployment of parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, to learn robustness to varied capture conditions.

**Result:** Through comprehensive experiments across 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA consistently shows improvements over the base models and previous adaptation methods in classification tasks.

**Conclusion:** VESSA demonstrates consistent improvements in downstream classification tasks compared to base models and previous adaptation methods, and it is significantly efficient in learning robustness to varied capture conditions.

**Abstract:** Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at

**Conclusion:** 提出的流水线展示了有效性和实用性，能更好地进行6D姿态估计，特别适用于工业环境中的物体。

**Abstract:** Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种基于深度学习框架的方法，通过微调、数据增强和公开数据集测试来改善模型性能。该方法包括开发一个自动分类框架以识别建筑物内外和结构部件，使用YOLOv11模型检测裂缝、剥落和暴露的钢筋，并进一步微调YOLO模型以区分不同的损伤级别。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，采用图像数据采集、标注和深度学习方法，可以实现地震后快速自动化地确定结构损伤等级。

**Abstract:** Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Previous 3D scene graph generation methods are limited to single-view settings and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, which are important for embodied scenarios in robotics.

**Method:** The method generates a 2D scene graph using VLM reasoning and then grounds it in 3D space using depth information, with nodes representing objects and edges capturing spatial and semantic relations.

**Result:** Experiments on the Replica and HM3D datasets show that ZING-3D effectively captures spatial and relational knowledge without task-specific training, demonstrating its potential for robotics applications.

**Conclusion:** ZING-3D provides a practical way to build 3D scene graphs for embodied AI applications, offering great promise in advancing research and applications in robotics and AI.

**Abstract:** Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的语义分割网络虽然依赖强大的预训练编码器，但大多数使用简单的解码器，导致在语义上下文和精细细节保留之间产生次优权衡。WaveSeg设计旨在优化此权衡。

**Method:** WaveSeg解码器架构，结合了空间和小波域的特征细化。首先从小幅图像中学习高频成分，用以增强早期阶段的边界细节。接着应用多尺度融合机制（DDO），并提出频谱分解注意力（SDA）块，以提升高频结构细节。同时，在小波域中应用可重构卷积来保持低频语义完整性。最终，通过残差引导融合整合多尺度特征和边界感知表示，得到语义和结构丰富的特征图。

**Result:** 在标准基准上的广泛实验显示，WaveSeg在量化和质量上都优于现有最先进的方法，实现了高效的精确分割。

**Conclusion:** WaveSeg通过利用小波域中频率前项及基于Mamba的注意力机制，成功提升语义分割的精度和效率。它的表现优于其他现有方法。

**Abstract:** While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Most Retinex-based image enhancement methods are time-consuming for large-sized images, which motivates the authors to develop a faster method using histogram-based approaches.

**Method:** This paper proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex model named HistRetinex for fast low-light image enhancement. It defines a histogram location matrix and a histogram count matrix to establish relationships among histograms. A two-level optimization model is constructed and solved to derive iterative formulas for the illumination and reflectance histograms.

**Result:** HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in visibility and performance metrics, while significantly reducing processing time for large images.

**Conclusion:** The proposed HistRetinex method achieves efficient and effective enhancement of low-light images with a notable speed improvement compared to traditional Retinex-based methods.

**Abstract:** Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

> 该研究介绍了一个新的任务——主动视觉推理（AVR），旨在让模型在部分可观察和交互的环境中通过主动获取信息并进行整合推理。通过展示在多个基准测试中的优越性能，揭示了现有具身MLLM在这方面的不足。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的视觉推理研究局限在静态和完全可见的场景中，不适用于现实世界中的信息不完整情况。通过对比人类如何通过主动探索和交互来完成视觉推理，此研究试图将这种能力扩展到深度学习模型中，使得它们能在部分可见和交互环境中表现良好。

**Method:** 此论文提出了一种名为主动视觉推理（AVR）的新任务，该任务要求模型在一个部分可观察且交互的环境中进行操作。模型必须通过序列化的物理操作来主动获取信息，整合多个步骤的观察结果进行连贯的推理，并基于不断演化的视觉反馈动态调整决策。为此，研究者们开发了CLEVR-AVR模拟基准测试，AVR-152k数据集，提供了详细的Chain-of-Thought注释，用于训练高阶马尔可夫决策过程中的代理。

**Result:** 开发的PhysVLM-AVR模型在CLEVR-AVR、OpenEQA和RoboVQA等互动和视觉推理任务中表现出色，但在遇到信息不完整时，现有的具身MLLM难以主动进行信息的获取和整合。

**Conclusion:** 研究证明了开发的PhysVLM-AVR模型在CLEVR-AVR、具身推理和被动视觉推理等任务上实现了最先进的性能。但也指出了当前具身MLLM在识别信息不完整和主动获取新信息的能力上的显著差距。

**Abstract:** Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

**Motivation:** 高分辨率的3D城市地图是自动驾驶、数字孪生和智能交通的关键组成部分。现有方法对垂直偏差、地面坡度和视点不匹配敏感，且没有考虑对象身份。因此，本文旨在提出一种能够精准地进行变化检测的方法，以克服上述局限性。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种面向对象且考虑不确定性的大规模城市LiDAR数据处理管道，该管道通过多分辨率NDT进行日期对齐，随后运用点到平面ICP法进行细化。此外，该方法通过登记协方差和表面粗糙度推导出了每个位置级别的探测度，以校准决策并抑制虚假变化。几何代理作为跨周期关联的种子，然后通过语义和实例分割进行改进，结合了附加虚拟元素的类约束双部分分配来处理分裂和合并情况，同时保留每个类别的数量。

**Result:** 在15个代表性的Subiaco街区上，该方法在准确率、mF1和mIoU上分别达到了95.2%、90.4%和82.6%，超过了Triplet KPConv方法，特别是在检测减少变化方面，IoU值达到了74.8%，提高了7.6个百分点。

**Conclusion:** 本文提出的方法提供了一种有效的方式来处理大规模LiDAR数据中的对象级变化检测，优于现有的方法，特别是在识别减少变化的情况下有明显的提升。

**Abstract:** High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the computational overhead associated with full-parameter fine-tuning of large-scale models and the limitation of direct prompt embedding methods, which lack inherent semantic priors.

**Method:** Our proposed method, Controllable-LPMoE, introduces a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters. It features a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor and a bi-directional interaction adapter with cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented adaptive scale enhancement.

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that Controllable-LPMoE outperforms 31 state-of-the-art methods in segmentation tasks, proving its efficiency and adaptability.

**Conclusion:** Experiments confirm the effectiveness of Controllable-LPMoE, which demonstrates superior segmentation performance and adaptability to various binary object segmentation tasks compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 系统地区分良性图像和有问题图像是一项具有挑战性的问题，因为图像中的细微改变（如侮辱性手势或符号）可能会大幅改变其安全性。然而，现有的图像安全性数据集是粗略和模糊的，仅提供广泛的标签而没有分离出驱动这些区别的具体特征。

**Method:** 通过引入SafetyPairs，一个可扩展的框架，用于生成反事实图像对，这些图像对仅在与给定安全策略相关的特征上有所不同，从而改变其安全标签。利用图像编辑模型，对图像进行针对性的修改，以改变其安全标签，同时保持与安全无关的细节不变。

**Result:** SafetyPairs作为强大的评估数据来源，展示出了视觉-语言模型在区分细微不同的图像方面的能力缺陷。此外，这个管道还可以作为一种有效的数据增强策略，提高了轻量级守卫模型训练的样本效率。

**Conclusion:** SafetyPairs提供了一个包含超过3,020个SafetyPair图像的基准，跨越了9个不同的安全性类别，为研究细粒度的图像安全性区分提供了第一个系统的资源。

**Abstract:** What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

**Motivation:** 现有的RL框架在增强多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）的一般CoT推理能力时，常难以泛化超出训练分布。

**Method:** 该研究提出了一种系统化的多模态强化学习框架NoisyGRPO，通过向视觉输入加入可控噪声以增强探索能力，并通过贝叶斯框架明确地建模优势估计过程。

**Result:** 实验表明NoisyGRPO显著提高了MLLMs（尤其是小规模模型）的一般CoT质量、能力和鲁棒性。

**Conclusion:** NoisyGRPO框架通过噪声注入与贝叶斯优势估计机制，有效地增强了MLLMs的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

**Motivation:** 传统的CT肺血管造影(CTPA)依赖于含碘对比剂，存在肾毒性和过敏反应的风险，尤其是对高危患者。因此，研究目的是开发一种不使用对比剂的方法来生成等效CTPA影像。

**Method:** 该研究提出了一种利用基于Cycle-Consistent生成对抗网络(CycleGAN)的级联合成器，从非对比CT(NCCT)扫描生成数字对比CT肺血管造影(DCCTPA)的方法，以减少传统CTPA对含碘对比剂的依赖带来的风险。

**Result:** 与现有方法相比，该方法取得了最佳的综合性能，评估了定量指标，同时实现了有效的血管增强、卓越的图像保真度和结构保留。在下游肺血管分割和血管量化任务中，测试集上的平均Dice、clDice和clRecall有显著提高。

**Conclusion:** 该研究表明，基于CycleGAN的方法可以有效地替代传统的CTPA，不仅减少了对比剂的使用风险，而且在图像质量和下游任务上表现优异。

**Abstract:** Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The aim is to address the limitations of existing Flow Matching models, which struggle to capture distinct signal characteristics and have high inference costs.

**Method:** Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM) divides the generative trajectory into smaller, specialized velocity blocks and employs a Semantic Feature Guidance module and Feature Residual Approximation strategy to improve inference efficiency and sample quality.

**Result:** Experiments on ImageNet 256x256 show that BFM achieves 2.1x to 4.9x accelerations in inference complexity with comparable generation performance.

**Conclusion:** BFM not only improves upon the generation quality but also significantly reduces computational costs compared to traditional Flow Matching methods.

**Abstract:** Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

> TokenCLIP adapts CLIP for fine-grained anomaly detection by dynamically aligning visual tokens with customized textual subspaces, addressing the limitations of the indiscriminate alignment approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current methods struggle with accurately capturing varied anomaly semantics due to their reliance on a single, token-agnostic textual space for alignment.

**Method:** TokenCLIP expands the token-agnostic space into orthogonal subspaces, dynamically aligning each token through an optimal transport problem formulation based on semantic affinity.

**Result:** Experiments show TokenCLIP's effectiveness in fine-grained anomaly detection compared to existing approaches.

**Conclusion:** TokenCLIP offers a more customized and efficient way to align visual and textual data for anomaly detection than the existing one-size-fits-all approach.

**Abstract:** Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

**Motivation:** 为了应对现有静态评估基准存在的数据污染和饱和问题，这些问题导致性能评估被夸大或误导。

**Method:** 通过图表示法对静态或动态的VQA样本进行建模。提出了一种名为知识增强基准演化（KBE）的动态多模态评估框架，该框架首先分析原始静态基准，然后通过整合多模态知识来扩展它，将静态基准转化为一个可控的、动态演化的版本。KBE能够通过重新选择原始图像中的视觉信息重建问题，或者使用外部文本知识扩展现有问题，从而实现难度可控的评估。

**Result:** 实验表明，KBE减轻了数据污染的风险、数据饱和问题，并且提供了多模态大语言模型能力的更全面评估。

**Conclusion:** KBE框架减轻了数据污染和饱和的风险，并提供了更全面的评估能力。

**Abstract:** The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

**Method:** iSM框架包含四项关键改进：内在引导、多级小波损失、缩放最优传输和孪生EMA策略。

**Result:** 在ImageNet 256 x 256上，对比基线快捷模型，iSM框架在一步、少步和多步生成时均显著提升了FID分数。

**Conclusion:** 本文提出的iSM框架大幅提升了快捷模型的性能，使其成为一种可行且竞争力较强的生成模型。

**Abstract:** Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** TSSR旨在实现高精度标记预测，并且能够并行生成，克服了顺序自回归方法的局限性。

**Method:** Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR)利用离散扩散模型（DDMs）生成高质量、艺术风格的3D网格，通过三种创新技术实现高效并行生成。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，TSSR可以在复杂数据集上生成高质量的3D艺术风格网格，最多可达10,000个面，空间分辨率为$1024^3$。

**Conclusion:** 代码将在https://github.com/psky1111/Tencent-TSSR公开，证明了TSSR生成的高质量3D网格的有效性。

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

> SAGE-3D augments 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with semantically and physically aligned features to improve its effectiveness in Visual-Language Navigation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to create more meaningful and physically interactive environments for VLN tasks, which current 3DGS methods cannot achieve adequately. This involves enhancing both the semantic and physical execution aspects of the 3D environments.

**Method:** 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) faces challenges in fine-grained semantics and physical interactions for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). The proposed SAGE-3D adds semantic object annotations and embeds collision objects to provide a physically interactive 3D environment.

**Result:** The proposed SAGE-3D, when tested, showed a 31% improvement in baseline performance on the unseen task in VLN-CE and established a new benchmark (SAGE-Bench) for 3DGS-based VLN tasks.

**Conclusion:** The experiments indicate that while 3DGS data is challenging to train with, it offers better generalization capabilities, enhancing VLN performance significantly in unseen scenarios. The final results and tools will be publicly available.

**Abstract:** 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

> 提出了一种名为FineRS的框架，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的强化学习来解决高分辨率图像中小物体的定位和分割问题，并且在新的数据集FineRS-4k上进行了性能测试，相比现有方法，FineRS取得了更好的结果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理高分辨率图像时面临理解并定位微小物体的挑战，尤其是在杂乱背景下嵌入的超小目标。FineRS旨在解决这个问题。

**Method:** FineRS采用了一个两阶段的管道，包含全局语义探索（GSE）和局部感知细化（LPR），用于定位和分割高分辨率场景中的极小物体。GSE通过指令指导推理生成粗略的目标区域，而LPR则细化该区域以生成准确的边界框和分割掩膜。为了连接这两个阶段，引入了一种基于定位信息的回顾奖励。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，FineRS在指令引导的分割和视觉推理任务上都优于现有的MLLMs方法，特别是在新的FineRS-4k数据集上。

**Conclusion:** FineRS框架展示了在高分辨率图像中进行小物体定位和分割的有效性，这对提升MLLMs的视觉理解能力具有重要意义。此外，开发者还提出了一个新的数据集FineRS-4k，用于评估MLLMs在复杂场景下的细小目标分割效果。

**Abstract:** Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

**Motivation:** 解决目前视觉-语言模型（VLMs）中对齐组件解释性不足的问题，这些模型虽具备强大的多模态推理能力，但难以将多模态表示的语义映射到统一的概念集中。

**Method:** 通过稀疏自编码器（VL-SAE）将视觉-语言表示编码到其隐藏激活中，以关联到由语义相似图像和文本表示的概念，并通过自我监督训练鼓励语义相似表示展示一致的神经元激活，从而解释这些表示的统一概念集。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，VL-SAE在解释和增强视觉-语言对齐方面表现出色，有助于提升零样本图像分类和幻觉消除等下游任务的表现。

**Conclusion:** VL-SAE通过构建一个基于距离的编码器和两个模态特定的解码器网络结构，能够加强视觉-语言表示在概念级别的对齐，使其解释性和对齐性能得到增强。

**Abstract:** The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

**Conclusion:** 通过结合形态、扰动和功能，FORM和MorphoEval开启了真实3D虚拟细胞模型的制造，在生物医学研究和药物开发中有重要意义。

**Abstract:** Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

**Motivation:** The motivation for this study is to address the challenge posed by the phenotypic heterogeneity of apple leaf diseases, which is not adequately handled by traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods, leading to difficulties in capturing both local and global features.

**Method:** The paper proposes a multi-branch recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). This framework synergistically uses a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. It includes an Adaptive Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) that dynamically fuses features and a multimodal image-text learning approach to mitigate interference from complex backgrounds, using pre-trained CLIP weights to align visual features with disease semantic descriptions.

**Result:** Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12% on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming several baseline methods.

**Conclusion:** The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities in recognizing agricultural diseases, enhances identification accuracy under complex environmental conditions, and provides an innovative and practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural applications.

**Abstract:** In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the limitations of existing UAV tracking methods, which focus on speed and neglect semantic awareness, resulting in suboptimal performance under challenges such as camera motion, fast motion, and low resolution.

**Method:** The core of the framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator combined with a Transformer correlation map. This generator explores semantic relevance to enhance the tracking accuracy and robustness. A pruning method is also designed to improve tracking speed and achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy.

**Result:** Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, showcasing competitive performance on various UAV tracking datasets.

**Conclusion:** The proposed dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling framework offers enhanced UAV tracking accuracy and robustness, while also providing a flexible balance between speed and accuracy through model variants.

**Abstract:** UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this work is to enhance the performance of VLMs in predicting future events and understanding current activities by leveraging eye gaze data, which provides crucial information about human attention and intent.

**Method:** The paper proposes a gaze-regularized framework which integrates gaze data into the training phase of visual language models (VLMs) through a gaze-regularized attention mechanism, thereby aligning the model focus with human visual attention.

**Result:** The experimental results show that the proposed method leads to improvements in semantic prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for current activity understanding compared to VLM baselines without gaze regularization.

**Conclusion:** This work demonstrates that the introduction of gaze-guided training can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of egocentric VLMs, setting the stage for more effective human-machine collaborations and applications, such as assistive robots.

**Abstract:** Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

**Motivation:** 为了参加SynthRAD2025挑战任务1和2，我们尝试了使用统一的管道从MRI和CBCT生成合成CT，动机是提升合成CT的结构保真度同时处理多区域的解剖配准问题。

**Method:** 我们的方法基于一个2.5D U-Net++模型，使用ResNet-34作为编码器，通过KonfAI框架实现从MRI和CBCT生成合成CT。该模型在不同的解剖区域上进行联合训练，并针对每个区域进行微调。损失函数结合了基于像素的L1损失和来自SAM与TotalSegmentator生成的感知损失IMPACT-Synth。训练使用AdamW优化器，初始学习率为0.001，每25000步减半，并在进行了归一化和人体掩模处理的切片输入上进行。

**Result:** 在本地测试集上，利用IMPACT的注册策略实现了比基于互信息的注册策略更准确解剖上一致的配准，产生了更低MAE的合成CT，且解剖结构更加真实。但在公共验证集上，使用Elastix配准的数据训练的模型得分更高，反映了评价流水线和配准策略一致性的注册偏差。

**Conclusion:** 我们的研究强调了注册误差如何影响监督学习中的训练和评估过程，重申了解剖一致性配准在改进合成CT生成模型中的重要性。通过使用IMPACT，可以缓解这种偏差，支持开发出更为鲁棒和通用的合成CT生成模型。

**Abstract:** We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

**Motivation:** 传统的扩散模型生成高质量图像时执行固定数量的去噪步骤，但这忽略了下游传输限制。在实际的云端到设备场景中，网络带宽的限制导致需要进行大量的压缩，从而导致细致纹理的丢失和计算资源的浪费。为解决这一问题，作者提出了一个新的框架。

**Method:** 提出了一种联合端到端训练策略，使扩散模型能够根据目标质量级别进行调节，这个级别由可用的带宽决定。在训练过程中，模型学习自适应地调节去噪过程，从而可以在保证感知质量与目标传输条件相匹配的前提下，实现早停采样。方法所需架构改动很小，并采用轻量级的质量嵌入来指导去噪轨迹。

**Result:** {

**Conclusion:** 实验结果显示，相比简单粗暴的早停策略，所提出方法显著提高了带宽适应生成的视觉保真度，为带宽受限环境下的图像高效传输提供了一个有前途的解决方案。

**Abstract:** In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current generative data augmentation frameworks by proposing a unified framework which can generate remote sensing images under spatial constraints for various vision tasks.

**Method:** TerraGen, a unified layout-to-image generation framework, is introduced, which includes a geographic-spatial layout encoder that unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial constraints.

**Result:** Experimental results demonstrate TerraGen achieves high generation image quality across diverse tasks and significantly enhances downstream task performance, showcasing robust cross-task generalisation.

**Conclusion:** TerraGen can be effectively used as a universal data-augmentation generator that enhances the performance of various vision tasks and shows robust generalisation ability in both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

**Abstract:** Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this

*Zhiying Jiang,Ruhao Yan,Zengxi Zhang,Bowei Zhang,Jinyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

> A new method for seamless image stitching that reduces ghosting and misalignment issues by constraining depth consistency and optimizing alignment through a multi-stage and low-cost computation approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** addresses the challenges of large parallax in image stitching leading to ghosting and misalignment by proposing a novel approach that improves alignment and stitching quality.

**Method:** proposes a depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method, which includes a multi-stage mechanism for enhancing alignment accuracy, a graph-based low-cost computation for determining an optimal stitching seam, and a reparameterization strategy for optimizing the structural design.

**Result:** experiments show superior performance compared to existing methods, with improvements in alignment and seam quality, while also enhancing computational efficiency.

**Conclusion:** the proposed depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method effectively mitigates parallax induced alignment errors and achieves high stitching quality, as evidenced by the experimental results.

**Abstract:** Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Main category: cs.CV

> The paper presents a benchmark (MUVR) for untrimmed video retrieval that supports multi-modal queries and evaluates various video retrieval models, highlighting their challenges and limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind the MUVR benchmark is to address the inadequacies of existing video retrieval methods in dealing with untrimmed and long videos, and to support multi-modal querying that better suits practical retrieval needs.

**Method:** The paper proposes a new benchmark named MUVR (Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval) that focuses on retrieving relevant segments from untrimmed and long videos using multi-modal queries. The benchmark includes features such as a practical retrieval paradigm with multi-modal querying, multi-level visual correspondence for defining retrieval criteria, and a comprehensive evaluation framework.

**Result:** The MUVR benchmark is composed of 53K untrimmed videos from the Bilibili platform, with 1,050 multi-modal queries and 84K matches. Evaluations show the limitations of current retrieval methods and MLLMs in handling untrimmed videos and multi-modal scenarios, providing insights for future research.

**Conclusion:** The MUVR benchmark advances the field of untrimmed video retrieval by focusing on long videos and multi-modal querying, offering a more practical approach with multi-level criteria, and providing a comprehensive basis for evaluating and improving retrieval models.

**Abstract:** We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的基于语言的视觉概念学习方法仅限于几个预定义的原始轴，如颜色和形状，这些方法通常在合成数据集中探索。面对人类可以轻易从多个语义维度解读视觉场景的能力，作者提出了一种能自动识别更多图像相关概念轴的方法。

**Method:** 提出了一种可扩展的框架，可以自适应地识别图像相关概念轴，并在真实世界场景中对视觉概念进行定位。利用预训练的视觉-语言模型和通用提示策略，该框架可以在没有先验知识的情况下识别多种图像相关轴。通用概念编码器可以自适应地将视觉特征绑定到发现的轴上，而无需为每个概念引入额外的模型参数。为了沿发现的轴定位视觉概念，优化组合锚定目标，确保每个轴可以独立操作而不影响其他轴。

**Result:** 在ImageNet、CelebA-HQ和AFHQ的子集上证明了框架的有效性，展示了在无法手动预定义的多样化实际概念上的优越编辑能力。该方法在视觉概念学习和文本驱动编辑方法方面表现出强大的组合泛化能力。

**Conclusion:** 该框架能够有效地在各种实际概念场景中进行组合编辑，证明了其相较于其他基于视觉概念学习和文本文本编辑方法的优势。代码可在其官方提供的GitHub仓库中获取。

**Abstract:** Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to develop a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and manipulation, capable of synthesizing human-made 3D objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic appearance.

**Method:** Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics by embedding sparse voxel representations and articulation properties into a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model is then trained to enable diverse yet physically plausible sampling. An articulation-aware Gaussian decoder is used to reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes with various articulation states.

**Result:** Experiments on furniture-like objects show that ArtiLatent outperforms existing approaches in terms of geometric consistency and appearance fidelity.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that ArtiLatent effectively synthesizes articulated 3D objects and provides a scalable solution for manipulation, demonstrating superior geometric and appearance consistency compared to existing methods.

**Abstract:** We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

> The paper proposes anisotropic pooling methods for table look-up CNNs to improve image restoration, outperforming average pooling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To enhance the performance of LUT-based CNNs in image restoration by addressing the issue with average pooling on anisotropic structures.

**Method:** Structure

**Result:** The proposed generalized median pooling and learned data-dependent pooling coefficients for anisotropic signal structures show superior results in image restoration benchmarks.

**Conclusion:** Anisotropic pooling methods can significantly improve the performance of LUT-realizable CNNs for image restoration tasks, offering perceptual and numerical improvements over conventional average pooling techniques.

**Abstract:** Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

<details>

**Motivation:** 现有方法在使用隐式表示，如神经辐射场，来刻画 3D 物体和场景的内在层次结构方面存在不足，主要表现为需要多次渲染或依赖预定义的离散层次结构，这限制了它们的理解能力和泛化能力。

**Method:** 通过使用连续的双曲线潜在空间表示场景层次结构，OpenHype 能够自然地编码多尺度关系，并通过潜在空间中的测地线路径实现层次结构的平滑遍历。这样既可以避免现有方法需要通过多次渲染来获取不同粒度的嵌入，也可以克服那些依赖预定义且闭合集合的离散层次结构的问题。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，OpenHype 在标准基准测试中优于现有的最先进方法，显示出更高的效率和适应性。

**Conclusion:** 研究提供了一种新的解决方案，即 OpenHype，它使用连续的双曲潜在空间来表示场景的层次结构，解决了现有方法在效率和泛化能力上的问题，从而提高了 3D 场景理解的能力。

**Abstract:** Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

**Abstract:** Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for

especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 在线视频异常检测（VAD）因实时约束和计算复杂性较少受到重视。本研究旨在解决在线VAD的内在复杂性问题。

**Method:** 介绍了一种新颖的基于内存的在线评分队列方案（MoniTor），用于无训练的在线视频异常检测。该方法采用流式输入到视觉语言模型，并引入了受LSTM启发的预测机制以更好地捕捉时间依赖性。同时设计了一种评分队列和异常先验机制，以动态存储最近的评分，并覆盖监控场景中的所有异常。

**Result:** 该方法在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence两个大型数据集上进行了评估，结果表明MoniTor优于最先进的方法，并且在无需训练的情况下与弱监督方法具有竞争力。

**Conclusion:** MoniTor在多个数据集上显示出优越的在线VAD性能，证明了流式输入和时间预测机制的有效性。

**Abstract:** Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

**Motivation:** 尽管语言和视觉语言模型在广泛的任务上表现出色，但它们的内部机制尚未完全理解，本文的目的是研究文本生成模型中的单个注意力头如何在特定的语义或视觉属性上专业化。

**Method:** 采用了一个已建立的可解释性方法，重新解读了使用最终解码层探测中间激活值的做法，通过信号处理的视角进行分析，以便系统地分析多个样本并基于目标概念的相关性对注意力头进行排名。

**Result:** 研究结果显示出跨单模态和多模态变压器注意力头在头部级别的专业化的一致性模式。实验表明，通过我们的方法选择的少至1%的注意力头的编辑可以可靠地抑制或增强模型输出中的目标概念。

**Conclusion:** 该研究揭示了注意力层内的可解释和可控制结构，提供了理解和编辑大规模生成模型的简单工具。

**Abstract:** Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing

> 为解决现有方法在严重内容损坏下时空稳定性不足的问题，我们提出了VidSplice框架，其通过将任务分离，设计新的模块，取得了更佳的补全效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前的视频补全方法通常使用图像到视频的先验知识来在被遮挡的帧之间模拟时间一致性，但在严重内容退化的情况下效率低下，并且容易忽略时空稳定性。为此，我们将视频补全都分离成两个子任务：多帧一致的图像补全和蒙版区域的运动传播。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种名为VidSplice的新框架，该框架通过引入间隔帧先验来指导基于时空线索的补全过程。为了增强空间一致性，我们设计了一个CoSpliced模块，该模块通过对初始帧内容进行扩散策略来处理后续参考帧。此外，我们引入了一个精细的上下文控制模块，该模块在帧复制后编码一致的先验信息，并将其注入到图像到视频的生成主干中，以有效约束生成过程中的内容扭曲。

**Result:** 大量的评估表明，VidSplice在各种视频补全场景中表现出了竟争性的性能。此外，其设计显著提升了前景对齐和运动稳定性的表现，超越了现有的方法。

**Conclusion:** 通过将视频补全都分离为多帧一致的图像补全和蒙版区域的运动传播，提出的VidSplice框架能够有效解决严重内容损坏下的时空稳定性问题，获得了超越现有方法的效果。

**Abstract:** Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

**Result:** CXR-LanIC框架发现在MIMIC-CXR数据集上训练的100个转译器能够发现约5000个单一语义的模式，覆盖心脏、肺部、胸膜等多个类别，这些模式在关键诊断准确性上表现出竞争力，并提供自然语言解释的基础。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，通过专注于特定诊断目标的分类器提取可解释特征，可以提高医学AI系统的透明度和临床相关性。这种方法不仅提高了系统的可解释性，而且支持了更安全的临床部署。

**Abstract:** Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，细胞级别聚集和组织-细胞交互对于细粒度计算病理学至关重要，提出的方法在组织学亚型分类任务中表现优于现有模型。

**Abstract:** Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究旨在解决闭合区域多摄像头视频中人体追踪的问题，特别是在人体遮挡频繁发生的情况下。

**Method:** GRAP-MOT方法用于解决闭合区域多摄像头视频中的人体多重假设追踪(MOT)问题，特别关注人体遮挡情况。该方法通过图加权的方式在线更新人体的身份标签，基于轨迹和人体特征。此外，GRAP-MOT还包含一个位置估计模块，提供额外的关键信息以提升追踪性能。

**Result:** GRAP-MOT在闭合区域模型的录制视频以及满足高密度空间要求的公开数据集上进行了测试，显示出了其优越性。

**Conclusion:** 研究分析了现有的MOT算法比较所用的度量标准，认为IDF1比MOTA更合适。而且，研究提供了代码及数据集的公开访问。

**Abstract:** GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的超声诊断方法严重依赖医生的经验，导致主观偏见和诊断不一致。本文旨在解决这些问题，提出一种基于小样本学习的改进模型，实现胎盘超声图像中血肿特征的自动检测，以确保母体和胎儿的安全。

**Method:** EH-YOLOv11n模型通过多维度优化提升了性能，它结合了小波卷积和坐标卷积以增强频率和空间特征提取，引入了级联组注意力机制来抑制超声伪影和遮挡干扰，从而提高了边界框定位精度。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，EH-YOLOv11n的检测精度达到78%，相比YOLOv11n提高了2.5%，相比YOLOv8提高了13.7%。该模型在精度-召回曲线、置信分和遮挡场景方面表现出显著优势。

**Conclusion:** EH-YOLOv11n模型在具有高准确性的同时实现了实时处理，为胎盘剥离的计算机辅助诊断提供了可靠的解决方案，具有重要的临床应用价值。

**Abstract:** Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

> We introduce GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer for fine-grained visual perception, which outperforms existing vision encoders and achieves state-of-the-art results in fine-grained recognition, VQA, and OCR understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing vision encoders focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional analysis, leading to limitations in fine-grained perception due to the scarcity of fine-grained annotated data and the lack of a fine-grained pre-training paradigm.

**Method:** We propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We construct the Gran-29M dataset to enable large scale fine-grained pretraining, and develop a pre-training-adaptation framework with a self-distillation mechanism to train GranViT.

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. It achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA, and OCR understanding.

**Conclusion:** Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating fine-grained perception and alignment with language models for vision-language tasks, achieving superior performance across various benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有方法对条件引导有不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间，模糊了关键设计选择。为了应对这一挑战，本文提出了一个统一的观点，即将条件引导重新定义为不动点迭代。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为Foresight Guidance (FSG) 的新方法，该方法在扩散模型的早期阶段，通过增加迭代次数来优先解决较长间隔的子问题。

**Result:** 在不同的数据集和模型架构上进行的广泛实验验证了FSG方法在图像质量和计算效率方面优于现有方法。

**Conclusion:** 本文的工作提供了对条件引导的新见解，开启了自适应设计的潜力。

**Abstract:** Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

> Foley Control是一种轻量级的视频引导Foley音效生成方法，通过在冻结的单模态模型间添加跨注意力桥接器实现同步学习，减少训练参数，保持强边缘性能，并提供模块化和可控性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 该方法旨在减少训练参数，从而降低计算成本，并保持提示驱动的可控性和生产友好型模块化。通过这种方式，Foley Control能够保持视频和音频模型的强大边缘性能，同时学习音频和视频之间的同步依赖。

**Method:** Foley Control采用轻量级方法，通过在预训练的单模态模型之间插入小型跨注意力桥接器来实现视频引导的 Foley 音效生成。该方法将V-JEPA2视频嵌入与冻结的文本到音频（T2A）模型连接起来，这样提示可以设置全局语义，而视频可以细化时间序列和局部动态。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，在精心挑选的视频-音频基准测试上，Foley Control在时间对齐和语义对齐方面性能优异，同时保持了最少的可训练参数数量。

**Conclusion:** Foley Control证明了跨注意力桥接器设计的有效性，并可能扩展到其他音频模态，如语音。这种方法实现了高效的视频引导音频生成，而无需重新训练音频前置模型。

**Abstract:** Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 论文动机在于解决Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)在文本到图像(T2I)生成中的两个主要限制：即优势归属不准确以及忽视生成过程中的时间动态特性。

**Method:** Chunk-GRPO方法通过将连续的步骤分组成捕获流匹配内在时间动态的'块'，并在块级别优化策略，从而改善了原有的GRPO方法中存在的精确优势归属不准确和忽视生成时间动态的问题。此外，还引入了一种可选的加权采样策略以进一步提升性能。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面都取得了优越的结果，突显了块级别优化对于基于GRPO的方法的潜力。

**Conclusion:** 研究结论强调了块级别优化策略在基于GRPO的T2I生成方法中的有效性和潜力。

**Abstract:** Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 夜间无人机操作面临显著挑战，包括低光条件下视觉感知能力受限、杂乱背景和频繁视角变化导致现有跟踪器漂移或失败。现有解决方案引入视觉伪影或计算成本高。

**Method:** MATrack系统包含三个主要模块：多尺度层次混合模块（MHB）增强静态和动态模板之间的特征一致性；自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的对象信息；夜间模板校准器（NTC）确保长时间序列中的稳定跟踪性能。

**Result:** 该研究针对夜间无人机跟踪的挑战，提出了一种多尺度自适应系统MATrack。该系统通过三个核心模块共同作业，有效增强特征一致性，准确识别复杂背景中的物体信息，并确保长时间序列中的稳定跟踪性能。实验表明，MATrack在UAVDark135基准上实现了精度、归一化精度和AUC的显著提升，分别超过现有顶级方法5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。这些结果显示了其在夜间搜索救援和边境巡逻等关键机器人应用中的可靠性。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，MATrack在多种测试基准上表现出优于现有顶级方法的性能和实时效率，证明了其在夜间复杂环境中的可靠性和有效性。

**Abstract:** Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper is motivated by the issue that current super-resolution methods degrade the readability of text in images despite improving the images themselves.

**Method:** TIGER adopts a 'text-first, image-later' strategy where text structures are reconstructed first and then used to assist in the super-resolution of the entire image.

**Result:** {
  "tldr": "TIGER is a two-stage method for super-resolution that prioritizes text readability while maintaining image quality, outperforming existing methods. It utilizes a 'text-first, image-later' paradigm and a new dataset called UltraZoom-ST.",
  "motivation": "The motivation behind TIGER is the existing trade-off between the quality of natural images and the readability of text within those images in super-resolution techniques.",
  "method": "TIGER decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement, first reconstructing precise text structures and then using them to guide full-image super-resolution.",
  "result": "TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance in enhancing readability while preserving image quality, as demonstrated in experiments.",
  "conclusion": "The method breaks the trade-off common in super-resolution methods between image quality and textual readability, demonstrating high fidelity and consistency.")

**Conclusion:** TIGER broke the common trade-off between image quality and text readability in super-resolution techniques by using a unique two-stage method and a new dataset provided for training and evaluation.

**Abstract:** Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文旨在展示深度学习模型可用于检测MEG记录中的间歇性尖波，即便是只有时间维度和单专家注释的数据，这也是真实世界临床实践的一个代表。目前的自动化方法要么需要大量标注数据，要么在非典型数据上缺乏鲁棒性。

**Method:** 本文提出了两种模型架构：基于特征的人工神经网络(ANN)和卷积神经网络(CNN)，使用59名患者的数据库进行训练，并使用经典的短时间窗口信号分类方法进行评估。此外，本文还采用了交互式机器学习策略，通过中间模型输出迭代改进数据标注质量。

**Result:** 两种提出的模型在10名测试患者中均优于最新模型（F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44）。交互式机器学习策略表明，这些模型对嘈杂注释具稳健性。

**Conclusion:** 总体结果表明，结构简单的模型在分析复杂且不完美标注的数据时表现出稳健性。我们的交互式机器学习方法为更快数据标注提供了巨大潜力，而我们的模型为自动化间歇性尖波检测提供了一个有用的、高效的工具。

**Abstract:** In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

**Motivation:** To address the issue of expensive pixel-precise annotations and improve generalization for related subtasks like DIS and HR-SOD.

**Method:** Structure

**Result:** Models trained on synthetic data show a 20-50% reduction in error in cross-dataset generalization, and fine-tuned models reach state-of-the-art performance.

**Conclusion:** The synthetic dataset and ambiguity-aware architecture significantly enhance the performance of salient object detection models and their generalization to real-world data.

**Abstract:** Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome the challenges of overconfidence and performance degradation in resource-constrained settings for cross-modal alignment models like CLIP.

**Method:** Modest-Align adopts Random Perturbation and Embedding Smoothing strategies to simulate uncertainty and calibrate similarity distributions in embedding space, respectively.

**Result:** Experiments across various datasets showed Modest-Align outperforms existing methods in retrieval tasks and is more efficient in terms of training data and GPU time.

**Conclusion:** Modest-Align provides a practical and scalable approach for robust cross-modal alignment in low-resource environments.

**Abstract:** Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

**Motivation:** 由于不同领域的点云数据量有限，现有的跨域点云数据结合方法可能导致下游3D点云分析任务性能下降，为解决这一问题，提出DAP-MAE。

**Method:** Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE)利用异构域适配器和域特征生成器，在预训练阶段使用适应模式，而在微调阶段使用融合模式，以从不同域的点云数据中全面学习并增强点云特征。

**Result:** DAP-MAE在仅需一次预训练的情况下，便在四个不同的点云分析任务中表现出色，包括ScanObjectNN中的目标分类任务上达到95.18%，Bosphorus上的面部表情识别任务上达到88.45%。

**Conclusion:** DAP-MAE通过结合跨域数据的优势并指导点云特性适应不同任务，实现高效的点云分析能力。

**Abstract:** Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

> 本文提出了一种名为Gompertz-CNN的新型动态知识蒸馏框架，此框架解决了传统方法无法有效传递知识的问题，通过Gompertz生长模型调整蒸馏过程，提升学生模型在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上的准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统知识蒸馏方法往往无法捕捉学生模型的认知能力演变，导致知识转移欠佳。本框架旨在通过学习进度动态调整蒸馏策略来克服这一限制。

**Method:** Gompertz-CNN, 一种整合Gompertz生长模型至训练过程中的全新动态知识蒸馏框架，采用阶段感知的蒸馏策略动态调整蒸馏损失权值，以反映学生的学习进度，同时引入Wasserstein距离测量特性层次上的差异，并通过梯度匹配来对齐教师模型和学生模型之间的反向传播行为。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，Gompertz-CNN在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上分别取得了最高8%和4%的性能提升。

**Conclusion:** 引入Gompertz生长模型的动态蒸馏策略及Wasserstein距离和梯度匹配的多损失函数框架可以在多种教师-学生架构中有效提升学生模型的性能。

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

**Motivation:** 解决基于视觉方法在人体动作捕捉时遇到的遮挡和环境监测工具的限制，以及仅使用IMU在位置估计和个体间相对定位方面的不足。

**Method:** 通过结合来自UWB的传感器间绝对距离与惯性观察来输入结构化状态空间模型，用于融合时态运动模式以精确估计3D姿势，同时采用两步优化来准确跟踪人们的全球轨迹。

**Result:** 提出了一个独特的IMU+UWB数据集GIP-DB用于两人跟踪，并展示了提出的方法Group Inertial Poser在合成和真实数据中的优越性。

**Conclusion:** 证明了IMU+UWB在野外多个人物体姿捕捉中的潜力和性能。

**Abstract:** Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于NACTI数据集表现出严重的长尾类不平衡，本文旨在研究并改进长尾识别技术以提高物种识别的准确性。

**Method:** 本文基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，对NACTI数据集上的长尾识别方法进行了系统研究，实验涵盖了多种长尾识别损失函数和敏感的正则化技术。

**Result:** 最佳配置在NACTI测试数据上达到了99.40%的Top-1准确率，显著优于使用标准交叉熵损失与Adam优化器的95.51%基线。在针对其他数据集的领域变化评估中，优化的长尾增强模型在减少偏见的测试集上达到了52.55%的领先准确率。

**Conclusion:** 本文通过实验优化了长尾增强调度器的选择，并结合最先进的长尾损失函数，展示了在NACTI野生动物领域中的显著改进。但也讨论了LTR方法在极端领域变化下对于'尾部'类别识别的不足。

**Abstract:** As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

> 本文提出了一种基于突触空间邻近性的无监督方法来对突触进行分类。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的突触分类方法是基于监督学习，而本研究所提出的无监督方法不需要预先知道突触的类别数量，可以更灵活地探索突触的多样性。

**Method:** 基于观察结果，即同一神经元中的相邻突触比随机选取的不同细胞中的突触更相似，本研究将突触分为不同类别。

**Result:** 该方法应用于果蝇的数据集上，能够不预先知道突触类型数量的情况下对突触进行分类。

**Conclusion:** 该无监督方法为突触分类提供了一种新的途径，并可能在选择涵盖突触结构全谱的基准数据时提供科学的原则性方法。

**Abstract:** Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

> 皮肤病理学背景下，评估了两个基础模型UNI和Virchow2作为全幻灯片成像(WSIs)的特征提取器的性能，实验表明Virchow2优于UNI，特别是在逻辑回归分类器中达到了90%的准确率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 皮肤病理学中全幻灯片成像(WSIs)的快速生成需要自动化的处理和精确分类方法。

**Method:** 此研究评估了两种基础模型UNI和Virchow2作为特征提取器对全幻灯片成像(WSIs)进行分类的性能。将补丁级别的嵌入通过平均聚合策略整合为幻灯片级别的特征，并用于训练多个机器学习分类器，包括逻辑回归(logistic regression)、梯度提升树(gradient-boosted trees)和随机森林(random forest)模型。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，使用Virchow2提取的补丁级别特征在大多数幻灯片级别分类器上的性能优于使用UNI提取的特征，特别是对于逻辑回归实现了最高准确性(达到90%)。尽管差异没有统计学显著性。

**Conclusion:** 研究还探讨了数据增强技术以及图像标准化来提升模型的稳健性和泛化能力。平均汇聚方法提供了可靠的幻灯片级别特征表示。所有实验结果和指标都使用WandB.ai平台跟踪和可视化，以促进可重复性和可解释性。本研究强调了基础模型在自动化WSIs分类中的潜在用途，提供了一种可扩展且有效的方法来进行皮肤病理学诊断，为未来在幻灯片级别表示学习上的发展铺平了道路。

**Abstract:** The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

> A hierarchical framework named WorldGrow is proposed for the unbounded synthesis of 3D scenes, addressing the issues of existing methods and achieving SOTA performance in creating photorealistic, structurally consistent infinite 3D worlds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The goal is to tackle the limitations of existing methods in 3D world generation, which often struggle with geometric and appearance inconsistencies or scalability issues. This paper aims to create a framework that can generate structurally consistent and photorealistic large-scale 3D worlds without these issues.

**Method:** Our method includes a data curation pipeline, a 3D block inpainting mechanism, and a coarse-to-fine generation strategy. This hierarchical framework, called WorldGrow, aims to address the challenge of generating infinite 3D worlds with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.

**Result:** The evaluation on the 3D-FRONT dataset shows that WorldGrow not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometry reconstruction but also can generate infinitely extendable scenes while maintaining photorealistic and structurally consistent outputs.

**Conclusion:** WorldGrow demonstrates strong potential as a tool for constructing large-scale virtual environments, highlighting its utility for the development of future, realistic world models.

**Abstract:** We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于对基于神经网络的黑箱模型缺乏信任，计算机视觉在生态学研究和保护监测领域的应用滞后。本文提出了解释预测和记录重要限制以增加信任度的方法。

**Method:** 文章使用Faster R-CNN对冰川湾国家公园的航空图像进行海豹检测，并采用了包括HiResCAM，LayerCAM，LIME和基于扰动的方法进行解释。接着对解释进行了定位保真度，忠实度和诊断效用的评估。

**Result:** 通过应用后验证解释方法来提供预测依据和记录对现场部署重要的限制，解决了生态学领域对基于神经网络的模型缺乏信任的问题。使用从冰川湾国家公园获取的航空图像，训练Faster R-CNN检测鳍足目动物（港海豹），并通过基于梯度的类别激活映射（HiResCAM，LayerCAM），局部可解释的模型无关解释（LIME）和基于扰动的解释方法生成解释。评估了三个与现场使用相关的解释：（i）定位保真度：高归属区域是否与动物重合而非背景；（ii）忠实度：删除/插入测试是否改变探测器的置信度；（iii）诊断效用：解释是否揭示系统性故障模式。解释主要集中在海豹的身体和轮廓上，而不是周围的冰/岩石，移除海豹会降低检测置信度，提供模型正确识别的证据。分析还揭示了反复出现的错误来源，包括海豹与黑色冰和岩石之间的混淆。将这些发现转化为模型开发的可操作下一步，包括更有针对性的数据整理和增强。通过将目标检测与后验证可解释性相结合，可以超越“黑箱”预测，向可审计且支持决策的生态保护监测工具迈进。

**Conclusion:** 通过这项研究，可以将对象检测与事后解释性相结合，来开发可审核的生态保护监控股能，并提出接下来可以采取的数据收集和增加多样性等改进措施。

**Abstract:** Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

> BachVid introduces a training-free method for generating consistent videos without needing reference images by analyzing DiT's attention mechanism and intermediate features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the limitation of current methods in text-to-video generation, which typically require reference images or extensive training and only address character consistency.

**Method:** Our method is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and intermediate features, which can extract foreground masks and identify matching points during the denoising process. The approach first generates an identity video and caches the intermediate variables, then injects these cached variables into the corresponding positions in newly generated videos, ensuring video consistency.

**Result:** Experimental results show that BachVid achieves robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training.

**Conclusion:** BachVid offers a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without relying on reference images or additional training.

**Abstract:** Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate

in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without

> The paper demonstrates that visual diffusion models can solve geometric problems effectively by transforming Gaussian noise into images representing valid approximate solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation of this paper is to show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective geometric solvers by working in pixel space, directly reasoning about geometric problems.

**Method:** Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image representing a valid approximate solution.

**Result:** The model successfully solves the Inscribed Square Problem, the Steiner Tree Problem, and the Simple Polygon Problem by learning to transform noisy geometric structures into correct configurations.

**Conclusion:** The results suggest a broader paradigm where operating in image space provides a general and practical framework for tackling challenging geometric tasks without specialized architectures.

**Abstract:** In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

> 提出一种自动化框架以检测视觉模型中的依赖属性，并通过自我反思迭代提升其性能，有效识别模型的潜在依赖关系。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 在视觉模型进行图像识别时，哪些视觉属性驱动其预测？检测对特定视觉特征无意中的依赖对于确保模型鲁棒性、防止过拟合以及避免虚假关联至关重要。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种自动化框架来检测经过训练的视觉模型中的这种依赖关系。该框架的核心是一个自我反思的代理，该代理系统性地生成并测试关于模型可能依赖的视觉属性的假设。该过程是迭代的：代理根据实验结果精炼其假设，并使用自我评估协议来评估其发现是否能准确解释模型行为。当出现不一致时，代理会进行自我反思并触发新一轮的实验。

**Result:** 我们在一个由130个模型组成的新型基准上评估了我们的方法，这个基准是为了展示18个类别之间的多样化视觉属性依赖关系而设计的。我们的结果显示，通过自我反思，代理的性能持续提高，并且相比于不进行反思的基线有显著的性能提升。进一步地，我们展示了该代理能够在最先进的模型中（包括CLIP的视觉编码器和YOLOv8目标检测器）识别实际的视觉属性依赖关系。

**Conclusion:** 此框架成功揭示了视觉模型在预测过程中依赖的视觉属性，尤其是在最先进的模型中，通过持续的自我反思，确保对模型依赖关系的理解更加准确可靠。

**Abstract:** When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.
