### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究提出DeBERTa-KC模型，用于自动分类在线科学学习讨论中的知识建构水平，实验结果表明该模型在处理类别不平衡和提升整体性能方面表现优异。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 这项研究的动机在于使用先进的自然语言处理模型来自动分类在线科学学习讨论中的知识建构水平，尤其是在非正式数字学习环境中。

**Method:** 该研究通过在DeBERTa-v3的基础上引入Focal Loss、Label Smoothing和R-Drop正则化来解决类别不平衡和提升泛化能力。研究团队实现了一个可重复的端到端流水线，包括数据抽取、标注、预处理、训练和评估。

**Result:** 在10折分层交叉验证中，DeBERTa-KC模型的宏观F1得分为0.836±0.008，显著优于经典和变压器模型基准。模型在探索和协商类别上表现尤为突出。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果证明，大规模语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中的知识建构细微指标，为基于理论的对话分析和自动工具发展提供了扩展方案。

**Abstract:** This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本研究评估了几种先进语言模型生成课件的能力，发现模型选择显著影响语言可读性，而提示框架则影响教学材料的准确性和课程对齐度。研究指出，结合阅读优化模型与RACE框架以及显式检查清单是生成有效课件的最佳配置。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本研究的动机在于评估现有先进语言模型生成教学材料的能力，以探索其在教育领域的潜在应用及局限性。

**Method:** 本研究评估了五大领先大型语言模型生成的课件的教学合理性与可用性，这些模型包括ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, 和 Grok 4。除了模型选择外，还测试了三种结构化提示框架：TAG，RACE，以及COSTAR。为一个高中物理主题《电磁波谱》生成了15个课件。通过四个自动计算指标对课件进行分析：可读性和语言复杂性、事实准确性与幻觉检测、标准和课程对齐、以及学习目标的认知需求。

**Result:** 研究结果显示，模型选择对语言可读性影响最大，DeepSeek生成的课件最易读（FKGL = 8.64），而Claude的课件语言密度最高（FKGL = 19.89）。提示框架结构则主要影响事实的准确性与教学的完整性，RACE框架虚幻检测率最低，与NGSS课程标准的偶然匹度最高。所有模型中，15个课件的学习目标大多位于布卢姆教学目标分类的“记忆”和“理解”层次。

**Conclusion:** 综上所述，研究表明可读性主要由模型设计决定，而教学可靠性和课程对齐度更加依赖于提示框架的选择。最有效的配置是将阅读优化模型与RACE框架相结合，并辅以物理概念、课程标准和高层次目标的显式检查清单。

**Abstract:** This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

> 提出ReDiff框架解决离散扩散模型中的错误累积问题，显著提高生成内容质量。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决离散扩散模型在实际应用中因训练-推理不一致导致的错误累积问题，提升模型生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性。

**Method:** 通过重新定义生成过程为积极修正过程，引入了ReDiff框架，该框架包含两个训练阶段：首先，通过纠正合成误差训练基础修正能力；其次，通过模仿专家的修正行为，实现在线自我修正。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，ReDiff显著提高了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，且相比传统的去噪方法，其具有更加稳定和高效的并行生成能力。

**Conclusion:** ReDiff通过主动修正错误，有效打破了错误累积的恶性循环，提升了模型的生成性能。

**Abstract:** Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本研究呈现了从Short Tracing方案和Stream算法的运用，能够使分析大型语言模型中的长上下文注意力模式变得可行，降低了计算和内存需求，提高了链式推理过程的可解释性，从而在普通GPU级别上实现大规模解释性分析。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 随着大型语言模型的上下文规模扩大到百万令牌，传统的机制可解释性技术对于分析注意力模式的扩展性不好，需要超过100,000令牌的太字节内存。这项研究的动机是提出一种可行的方法来有效分析大型模型的长时间上下文。

**Method:** 研究采用了Sparse Tracing技术，使用Stream算法，此算法设计为在近似线性时间和线性空间内工作，并利用二分查找样式的精炼策略保留每个查询的前k个关键块，同时保持模型的下个令牌行为不变。

**Result:** 本研究介绍了Sparse Tracing技术，使用动态稀疏注意力分析大型语言模型中的长上下文注意力模式，提出了一种名为Stream的可编译分层剪枝算法，可以近似线性时间O(T log T)和线性空间O(T)估计每头的稀疏注意力掩码，实现大规模解释性分析。Stream算法通过保留每个查询的前k个关键块，同时保存模型的下一令牌行为，只要97-99%的令牌交互被修剪。在RULER基准测试中，该方法保留了关键的检索路径，丢弃了90-96%的交互，并揭示了逐层路径。Sparse Tracing为分析注意力模式和追踪信息流提供了一种切实可行的工具，使长上下文的可解释性在消费者级别的GPU上变得可行。代码可在https://anonymous.4open.science/r/stream-03B8/获得。

**Conclusion:** Sparse Tracing技术，特别是Stream算法，提供了一种有效的方法来分析大型语言模型的注意力模式，维护长上下文解释性的同时大大减少了计算和内存需求。它开启了使用普通消费者级别的GPU实现长上下文解释性的可能性，有助于普及链式推理监控。

**Abstract:** As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种用大型语言模型识别非结构化电子健康记录中患者HIV检测适合性的新方法，在实验中达到了高准确性同时保持了较低假阴性率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 虽然大规模实验室测试不可行，但电子健康记录（EHRs）的广泛应用提供了新的机会来应对这一挑战。现有研究主要集中在应用机器学习方法对结构化数据进行分析，如患者的人口统计学信息，以改善HIV的诊断。这些方法通常忽略了临床笔记等非结构化文本数据，而这些数据可能包含与HIV风险相关的重要信息。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）分析非结构化电子健康记录文本的新方法，以判断患者是否适合进一步进行HIV检测。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，该方法在Erasmus大学医学中心Rotterdam的临床数据上实现了高精度，并保持了较低的假阴性率。

**Conclusion:** 本研究展示了利用大型语言模型分析非结构化EHRs文本信息以早期诊断HIV的巨大潜力，能够在减少传播的同时提高检测效率。

**Abstract:** Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究评估了11个LCA相关任务的LLMs表现，发现幻觉率较高，但在格式遵守和解释质量上有一定优点，强调了LLM使用的注意事项。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 此研究旨在提供首个基于专家的LLMs在LCA中的基准，解决该领域缺乏标准化评估框架的问题，特别是在没有明确的地面实况或共识协议的情况下。

**Method:** 本研究评估了十一款通用大型语言模型（LLMs），包括商业和开源模型，通过22个与生命周期评估（LCA）相关的任务。17位经验丰富的从业者根据LCA实践相关的标准，如科学准确性、解释质量、稳健性、可验证性和遵守说明情况，对模型输出进行了审查，共收集了168份专家评审。

**Result:** 专家们认为37%的回应包含不准确或误导性的信息。许多模型的准确性和解释质量得分一般到良好，即使是一些较小的模型。格式遵守情况总体上得分较高。幻觉率差异显著，某些模型产生的幻觉引用率高达40%。在开放权重和封闭权重LLMs之间的评分没有明确区分，开放权重模型在准确性、解释质量等方面的表现与封闭权重模型相当或更优。

**Conclusion:** 研究发现突显了在LCA中未经思考地应用LLMs的风险，尤其是在将LLMs视为自由形式的神谕时，但也展示了诸多好处，尤其是在解释质量改进和简化简单任务方面。普通LLMs在没有接地机制的情况下使用...（结论部分似乎未完整给出，基于现有信息可以推测结论部分可能会讨论平衡LLMs的优点和风险，需要进一步指导或框架的发展）。

**Abstract:** Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

> 提出了一种新的基于游戏的多模态语言模型评估方法，揭示了其与现有评估方法的相关性，并分析了人机之间的差异。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 旨在解决静态独立基准无法全面评估多模态大语言模型的能力、以及依赖人类或模型间两两比较方法的高度主观性、高成本性和容易让模型通过表面技巧（例如冗长）来提高胜率的问题。

**Method:** 提出了一种基于游戏的评估方法，通过Dixit幻想卡牌游戏评估多模态大语言模型的各种能力。在这个游戏中，玩家需要为卡牌生成描述，使部分玩家能选中，而其他玩家则不能。

**Result:** 游戏化评估方法在Dixit卡牌游戏中表现出了与传统多模态大语言模型评估基准完美相关的胜率排名，同时揭示了人类玩家与模型玩家之间的策略差异及模型推理能力的改进空间。

**Conclusion:** 相较于传统评估方法，基于游戏的评估能更全面有效地考核多模态大语言模型能力。

**Abstract:** Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

### [8] [Large Language Model enabled Mathematical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19895)
*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究探讨了DeepSeek-R1模型在优化建模中的潜在应用，特别是在解决现实世界中的供应链问题时，通过NLU和代码生成技术系统评估其在OR场景中的表现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本研究旨在探索大规模语言模型（LLMs）在解决优化建模中形式化差距的潜力，特别是在成本效率和高表现力方面表现突出的DeepSeek-R1模型。

**Method:** 该研究系统地评估了DeepSeek-R1在四个关键OR基准测试上的表现：NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP和ComplexOR。研究方法包括基线评估，开发了幻觉分类法，并应用了减少幻觉、提高公式准确性以及更好地将模型输出与用户意图对齐的技术，如LLM作为评判、少样本学习（FSL）、工具调用和多智能体框架。

**Result:** 研究结果将揭示DeepSeek-R1在不同OR基准测试中的表现，以及幻觉减少和用户意图对齐策略的有效性。

**Conclusion:** 通过这一研究，我们可以更深入地了解DeepSeek-R1在实际OR场景中的应用潜力及其局限性，为进一步优化和改进奠定了基础。

**Abstract:** The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种记忆增强的框架，用于在不更新参数的情况下，通过标记的数据和模型自生成的批评来改进LLM的学习能力。实验表明此方法能显著提升模型在多种任务上的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的模型调优方法往往代价高昂、灵活性差且不透明，因此我们试图通过引入记忆增强的方法来改进模型的学习能力，以无需参数更新的方式学习目标分类函数。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种基于记忆增强的框架，该框架结合了标记的数据以及由大型语言模型生成的批评，以提高任务性能。框架利用情节记忆存储实例级的批评，捕获特定的过去经验，并使用语义记忆将这些经验提炼为可以重复利用的任务级指导。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，与其他仅依赖标签的检索基础模型（如RAG模型）相比，引入批评能够提升最多24.8%的准确性。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果显示，基于记忆驱动的反思学习有助于构建更具有适应性和可解释性的大型语言模型代理。

**Abstract:** We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

> LyriCAR是一种全新的无监督歌词翻译框架，通过难度逐步增加的训练方法提高翻译质量，特别是在多行连贯性和整体韵律方面表现出色。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的歌词翻译方法依赖于手工规则和句子级建模，这些方法在学习音乐与语言之间的关系和跨行连贯性的能力方面存在局限性，因此难以在段落级表现优秀。

**Method:** LyriCAR, 一种新颖的可控歌词翻译框架，采用无监督学习方式。该框架引入了一个难度意识的课程设计者和自适应课程策略，以提高训练资源的使用效率，加快收敛速度，并通过逐步增加翻译难度来提升整体翻译质量。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，LyriCAR在中英歌词翻译任务上取得了当前最优性能，不仅在标准翻译评估指标上表现优异，在多维度奖励评分上也表现出色。此外，自适应课程策略显著减少了训练步骤，降低了约40%，同时保持了卓越的性能。

**Conclusion:** LyriCAR作为一款创新的框架，在歌词翻译领域里明显优于现有方法，能够高效地学习和应用音乐与语言间的复杂模式。

**Abstract:** Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

### [11] [LLM-Augmented Symbolic NLU System for More Reliable Continuous Causal Statement Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19988)
*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文探讨了一种将大语言模型（LLMs）的广泛语言处理能力和基于符号的NLU系统的结构化、关系表示能力相结合的混合方法。该方法在从常识科学文本中提取和解释数量和因果定律的任务上显著优于全符号方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管大型语言模型具有广泛应用，但其对概率推理的依赖使其容易出现生成事实错误和自然语言理解任务中的不一致输出结构问题。相比之下，基于符号的NLU系统通过精心策划的词典、语义资源和语法及语义解释规则提供了可解释的理解。这些系统生成的关系表示可以用于准确推理和规划，以及增量调试学习。然而，基于符号的NLU系统在覆盖范围上不如LLMs广泛，且需要稀缺的知识表示和语言学技能来扩展和维护。因此，探索了将两者优势结合起来的方法。

**Method:** 该研究提出了一种混合方法，结合了大语言模型（LLMs）的广泛语言处理能力和基于符号的自然语言理解（NLU）系统的结构化、关系表示能力。使用LLMs进行文本重述和简化，以实现广泛覆盖，并作为自动填补知识空白的信息来源。同时，利用符号NLU来产生可用于推理和增量学习的表示。

**Result:** 在提取和解释常识科学文本中的数量和因果定律的任务上，该混合方法显著优于完全依赖符号的方法及其单一的LLM或符号NLU系统。

**Conclusion:** 这种混合方法在利用LLMs的广泛覆盖性和符号NLU系统的结构化表示能力方面显示出了优势。这种方法为开发更加强大和准确的自然语言处理系统提供了新的方向。

**Abstract:** Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

**Motivation:** 本文旨在提出一种更接近人类大脑解析机制的自然语言句子解析方法，从而提高解析的效率和准确性。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种逐词解析的算法，该算法将自然语言句子解析为依存树。这种方法与短语结构解析器不同，更接近人类大脑中的语言解析特性。

**Result:** 算法最坏情况下的复杂度为O(n^3)，但对于人类语言而言，只有在小n的情况下才会出现这种最坏情况。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，基于逐词解析的算法可以有效模拟人类大脑中的语言解析过程，虽然存在最坏情况复杂度O(n^3)，但在实际应用中表现良好。

**Abstract:** This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as

**Conclusion:** 打开了比较各种领导模型的对话，并提供了上写作高精度论文的路线。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Given the challenges posed by a fragmented research landscape and limited architectural variety in natural language processing for Greek, especially in specialized, valuable fields like law, this paper aims to develop more effective and modern models.

**Method:** This paper details the creation of Greek Embedding Models (GEM), a new series of transformer models for the Greek language, addressing the issue of a fragmented research landscape in morphologically rich languages, and provides extensive data curation for training datasets from both general and legal domains. The research evaluates modern architectures like ELECTRA, ConvBERT, and ModernBERT.

**Result:** The experimental results reveal that GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models outperform existing baselines significantly, proving the effectiveness of the approach proposed in the paper.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that the Greek Embedding Models, particularly GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT, set a new benchmark in Greek NLP and underscore the importance of quality-driven data curation and modern model architectures.

**Abstract:** The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

> This doctoral thesis enhances sequence labeling tasks by refining pre-trained neural language models with a multi-task setting, architectural improvements, and an in-context fine-tuning framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to enhance the performance of pre-trained neural language models on sequence labeling tasks through targeted transfer learning techniques.

**Method:** The paper introduces three improvements in transfer learning for sequence labeling tasks: (1) a multi-task model with an additional signal, (2) architectural modifications enabling bidirectional information flow in autoregressive large language models, and (3) a sequence labeling framework utilizing in-context fine-tuning and response-oriented adaptation strategies.

**Result:** The proposed methods show that pre-trained neural language models perform better on sequence labeling tasks when equipped with these improvements through targeted transfer learning.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the enhancements like the multi-task model, architectural modifications, and the in-context fine-tuning method lead to significant improvements in sequence labeling tasks when using pre-trained neural language models.

**Abstract:** This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

> 提出ToolScope增强LLM依赖工具进行复杂任务处理的能力，通过减少工具冗余和智能选择相关工具，有效提升工具选择的准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型(如LLM代理)依赖外部工具来解决复杂的任务，但现实世界的工具集通常包含重叠和冗余的工具，导致名称和描述的矛盾，降低了选择的准确性。此外，LLMs输入上下文长度有限制，阻碍了有效考虑大规模工具集。为解决这些挑战，提出了ToolScope。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种方法ToolScope，它包含两个主要部分：(1) ToolScopeMerger与自动修正功能，用于自动审核和纠正工具合并，减少冗余；(2) ToolScopeRetriever，用于排名和选择与每个查询最相关的工具，从而将工具集压缩以适应输入上下文限制而不影响准确性。

**Result:** 评估显示，在三个最先进的LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试上，工具选择准确性提高了8.38%至38.6%，证明了ToolScope在提升LLM工具使用有效性的有效性。

**Conclusion:** 评估结果表明，ToolScope在增强LLM工具使用效率方面是有效的，尤其是通过减少冗余和智能选择相关工具来提升工具选择准确性。

**Abstract:** Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

**Motivation:** 虽然最近的多语言基准测试在评估LLMs的文化理解能力方面取得了进展，但在捕捉低资源文化的细微差别方面存在关键差距，本文旨在解决这些限制。

**Method:** 通过创建Bengali语言文化知识(BLanCK)数据集，其中包括民间传统、烹饪艺术和地方方言，来评估几种多语言语言模型在文化知识方面的表现。

**Result:** 研究发现这些模型在非文化类别中表现良好，但在文化知识方面则表现出显著的不足。提供上下文时，所有模型的性能都大幅提升。

**Conclusion:** 强调了基于上下文的架构和文化精选训练数据的重要性。

**Abstract:** Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

**Motivation:** 研究动机在于增强小型语言模型的推理能力，这对于特定的应用程序（如医学问答）在波斯语等不受重视的语言中至关重要。

**Method:** 本研究使用增强学习与AI反馈（RLAIF）和直接偏好优化（DPO）方法，以提高通用波斯语语言模型的推理能力。具体而言，研究人员将多选题医疗问答数据集翻译为波斯语，并利用RLAIF生成DPO训练所需的答案对。通过提示教师模型和学生模型生成CoT推理响应，研究人员收集了包含正确和错误推理路径的数据集，该数据集包括200万标记的优选答案和250万标记的拒绝答案。

**Result:** 研究成功地训练了一个基础模型，显著提高了其在医疗推理领域的波斯语能力。值得注意的是，与使用约5700万标记数据训练的前辈模型gaokerena-V相比，本研究模型的表现更优，即使其训练数据量较小。

**Conclusion:** 研究成果展示了针对推理能力训练方法的有效性和效率，特别是在数据资源稀缺的情况下，对于开发领域特定的语言模型具有重要意义。

**Abstract:** Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

**Motivation:** 鉴于目前评价模型创造力的方法碎片化，并且定义和衡量标准各不相同，缺乏全面的框架来评估，本文提出了CreativityPrism框架，旨在填补这一空白。

**Method:** 研发了一种名为CreativityPrism的评估分析框架，该框架将创造力分解为三个维度：质量、新颖性和多样性，包含九个任务、三个领域（发散思维、创造性写作、逻辑推理）以及二十个评估指标。

**Result:** 评估了17个最先进的专有和开源的大型语言模型，并分析了不同度量和任务领域之间的性能相关性。结果显示专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明模型在一个创造力任务或维度上的强表现不一定能推广到其他方面，强调了对大型语言模型创造力进行全面评估的重要性。

**Abstract:** Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

> BoundRL是一种用于结构化文本分割的新方法，它能够有效处理复杂文本，并通过强化学习和中间候选片段策略提高分割质量。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有句级或段落级分割方法无法有效处理包含表格、代码片段和占位符等元素的复杂结构化文本。

**Method:** 提出了一种新颖且高效的方法BoundRL，用于对长结构化文本进行联合的token级文本分割和标签预测。BoundRL通过仅生成每个片段的起始token序列，并在原文中定位这些token来重构完整内容，从而显著降低推理成本并减少幻想误差。此外，通过系统地扰动生成的片段序列的一部分来构建中间候选片段，有助于缓解熵崩溃问题，最终导向更高质量的解决方案。

**Result:** 实验表明，BoundRL使得小规模语言模型（1.7B参数）在对复杂提示的分割任务中性能优于大型语言模型的少数样本提示。同时，RLVR方法带来了显著的性能改善，并且通过中间候选片段进一步提高了性能和泛化能力。

**Conclusion:** BoundRL方法展示了其在处理复杂结构化文本的有效性，尤其是对于大模型来说难以处理的复杂提示任务，小模型通过BoundRL能够表现出更好的性能。

**Abstract:** As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于立场检测涉及标记一个陈述对于特定目标的反对、赞成或中立态度，并且经常会涉及到政治倾向，使其成为最敏感的NLP任务之一。然而，社区对于这种偏见的评估在立场检测方法中普遍被忽视了。因此，该论文专注于在零样本设置下执行立场检测时大型语言模型的偏见。

**Method:** 通过自动注释现有立场检测数据集中的帖子来研究这些问题属性是否影响模型的立场检测决策。使用的两个属性是特定群体的方言或俚语以及文本复杂度/可读性。

**Result:** 研究表明，LLMs在立场检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象，例如将支持大麻的观点与较低的文本复杂度相关联，将非洲裔美国方言与反对唐纳德·特朗普相关联。

**Conclusion:** 研究揭示了大型语言模型在立场检测任务中的显著偏见，这对于制定减少这种偏见和提高立场检测公平性的策略至关重要。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

> 介绍DeepWideSearch，用于评估信息检索代理在深度推理和广度信息收集方面的能力，展示了现有代理在这方面的不足，公开此基准以促进未来研究。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前搜索代理在进行多跳检索的深度推理和拓宽信息收集范围上存在不足，这对全面市场分析和业务发展等实际应用有重要影响。该研究旨在解决这一问题。

**Method:** DeepWideSearch 是一个用于评估信息检索代理的基准测试，该测试要求代理在处理大数据时既能进行深度逻辑推理也能进行广度信息收集。研究通过两种方法扩展已有数据集，从而创建了包含220个问题，跨越15个不同领域的精心策划的集合。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，即使是目前最先进的代理在DeepWideSearch上的平均成功率也只有2.39%，这表明在信息检索任务中整合深度和广度的搜索面临巨大挑战。

**Conclusion:** 研究揭示了代理架构的关键局限性，包括缺乏反思、过度依赖内部知识、检索不足和上下文过载四种失败模式。DeepWideSearch公开发布，旨在推动未来更加有能力且稳健的信息检索代理的研究。

**Abstract:** Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

> 论文提出了一种结合多智能体工作流程与强化学习来提高表格理解的Mixture-of-Minds框架，并展示了在TableBench基准上的62.13%得分，超越了其他现有模型。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型在处理表格理解和推理任务方面虽显示出潜力，但目前的方法存在局限性，如基于微调的方法容易出现算术错误和虚假信息，而工具型方法依赖于刚性的模式并缺乏语义理解。这些互补的弊端促使了开发结合稳健推理与可靠的表格处理方法的需求。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为Mixture-of-Minds的多智能体框架，该框架将表格推理分解为三种专门角色：规划、编码和回答，每个代理专注于任务的一个特定方面，并利用代码执行进行精确的表格操作。此外，引入了自我改进训练框架，采用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）生成伪金标准轨迹，并通过强化学习（RL）优化代理。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，Mixture-of-Minds在TableBench上达到了62.13%的分数，超过了OpenAI-o4-mini-high的表现。

**Conclusion:** 这些结果证明，将结构化的多智能体工作流与强化学习相结合是推进表格理解的一个有前景的方法。

**Abstract:** Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

> 本文研究了大型语言模型在空间推理方面的表现，发现它们在处理简单任务时表现尚可，但在复杂性增加时性能迅速下降，表明这些模型缺乏强大的空间表示。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 为了探索LLMs的空间推理能力及其处理结构化环境中的多步骤问题的能力。

**Method:** 通过五项任务套件测试了大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本输入上的空间推理能力，任务包括四象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和棋盘移动。任务的复杂度通过增加网格尺寸递增，要求模型超越简单的模式识别，进行抽象的空间推理。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，LLMs在所有小规模和低复杂度任务中表现中等，但准确性随着复杂度的增加而大幅下降，平均下降42.7%，最大下降84%。

**Conclusion:** 该研究揭示了LLMs在空间推理方面的局限性，表明了语言和几何学之间需要更进一步的整合基准。

**Abstract:** This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

> 本文专注于改进大型语言模型评估方法，通过无解码抽样策略提高边缘估计的准确性和效率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于LM在评估时是对特定标记化结果的概率进行测量，而不是考量所有可能的标记化方法，这种方法的准确性存在局限。本文旨在改善LM评估的准确性。

**Method:** 本文探讨了无解码抽样策略，这些策略不需生成文本，而是依赖于非常便宜的抽样策略，与模型和标记器无关。

**Result:** 研究证明了无解码抽样策略在开放模型中能提供足够准确的边缘估计，并且在不到原先运行时成本的一个小部分的情况下完成。

**Conclusion:** 无解码抽样策略为LM在推理任务中的应用提供了一个快速且准确的边缘估计方法。

**Abstract:** Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种整合文本、音频和面部信号的三模态情感严重程度框架，可以同时评估抑郁症和PTSD，并提供每个疾病的概率估计和特征级别的解释，其性能优于单一模态方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于抑郁症和PTSD常常共病存在且症状相连，使得针对这两种疾病的自动评估工作变得复杂。传统的自动评估往往是二元的且针对特定疾病。临床有用的诊断需要考虑到严重程度且跨越多种疾患的估计以及决策支持解释。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，该框架通过整合文本、音频和面部信号来评估抑郁症和创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)的严重程度。文本部分使用句子级别的转换嵌入，音频部分使用Mel频谱统计特征，面部信号部分使用表情动作单元、凝视、头部和姿态描述符。这些标准化特征通过一个校准的后期融合分类器进行融合，输出每种疾病概率和特征级别的归属。

**Result:** 该方法通过DAIC衍生语料上的分层交叉验证，其性能优于单一模态和消融基线模型。在准确性与加权F1指标上与最强单模态基线持平，同时在决策曲线实用性和鲁棒性上有所提升，尤其在面对噪声或模态缺失的情况下。对于抑郁评分，文本贡献最大；对于PTSD，音频和面部特征最为关键。

**Conclusion:** 该研究证明了提出的三模态情感融合框架在抑郁症和PTSD并发评估中的有效性。特别是在面对噪声多或者模态缺失的情况下，融合模型相比最强的单一模态基线，提高了决策能力的稳定性和准确性。对于PTSD来说，融合模型减少了回归误差并且提升了分类一致性。

**Abstract:** Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现代大规模语言模型预训练中的字令牌预测限制了模型捕捉高层语义结构和长范围上下文关系的能力。因此，提出了一种新模型来克服这一限制。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为ContextLM的框架，通过引入“next-context prediction”的目标来增强标准预训练方法，使模型能够学习到多令牌上下文的预测表示，并利用未来令牌块的错误信号进行训练。

**Result:** 实验表明，ContextLM在GPT2和Pythia模型族中的表现表现出一致的困惑度和下游任务性能改进。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，通过next-context预测提供了更强语言模型的可扩展和高效路径，改善了长范围连贯性和注意力分配，且计算开销较低。

**Abstract:** Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

**Motivation:** 本文旨在解决大语言模型在引用证据时可能出现的引用失败问题，即使模型生成了有用的回答也未能完整引用证据。

**Method:** 本文提出了一个两步的方法来解决引用失败的问题。首先，研究了引用失败发生的情况，并通过CITECONTROL基准测试来系统地分析这种失败模式。其次，提出了CITENTION框架，该框架整合了生成式、基于注意力和基于检索的方法来提高语言模型引用的效率。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，随着关系复杂性的增加，失败次数增加，并表明结合引用方法可以提高表现。CITENTION在CITECONTROL基准测试和转移设置中展现了显著的引用改进。

**Conclusion:** 本文展示了通过对引用失败的研究和开发新的引用框架，能够改善语言模型的引用质量。

**Abstract:** Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** PRMs在数学等领域的复杂推理中表现出色，但其在涉及半结构化数据的任务中的适用性尚未探索。由于TQA具有大量无关信息、松散的推理步骤和领域特定的推理，因此有必要研究PRMs在TQA中的表现。

**Method:** 本研究首次系统地研究了PRMs在表格问题回答（TQA）中的应用，评估了最先进的生成性PRMs在TQA中的表现，并从答案和步骤两个层面进行了分析。

**Result:** 研究结果显示，结合文本和代码验证的PRMs有助于选择解决方案，但在泛化到域外数据时显得困难。分析表明，步骤级验证的表现与答案准确性之间的相关性较弱，这可能源于步骤间的弱依赖性和因果联系的松散。

**Conclusion:** 研究指出当前PRMs在TQA上的局限性，并为构建更强大的、对过程敏感的验证者提供了有价值的见解。

**Abstract:** Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

**Motivation:** 大型推理模型在处理复杂数学运算时表现出效率低下或不准确的问题，CoRT旨在解决此问题，使模型能更好地与外部确定性知识，如代码解释器，进行互动。

**Method:** 通过Hint-Engineering策略合成高质量的代码集成推理数据，并使用监督微调方法来后训练模型。此外，还使用拒绝采样和强化学习进一步优化模型性能。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，CoRT在五个数学推理数据集上分别提高了4%和8%的准确率，并减少了大约30%和50%的token使用量。

**Conclusion:** CoRT框架成功提高了大型推理模型与代码解释器互动的能力，在提高推理性能的同时也提高了效率。

**Abstract:** Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

**Motivation:** 评估大型语言模型时，往往忽略数据集污染的影响，研究动机在于探究大型语言模型是否对广泛使用的表格基准数据集（如Adult Income, Titanic等）存在先验知识。

**Method:** 通过一系列控制探测实验，研究了数据集包含强烈语义线索（如有意义的列名或可解释的值类别）对大型语言模型性能的影响。

**Result:** 实验显示，带有强烈语义线索的数据集会出现记忆影响，而当移除或随机化这些线索时，模型性能急剧降低至近乎随机水平。

**Conclusion:** 大型语言模型处理表格推理任务的能力可能部分源自对公开数据集的记忆。研究提出了未来评估协议的改进建议，旨在分离语义泄漏与真实推理能力。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

**Motivation:** To improve the adaptability and effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by addressing the limitations of existing fixed-granularity chunking paradigms.

**Method:** FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework, which treats sentences as atomic units to support flexible retrieval of arbitrary sentence combinations, shifting from static chunk segmentation.

**Result:** FreeChunker demonstrates superior retrieval performance and computational efficiency relative to traditional chunking methods on the LongBench V2 dataset.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method significantly advances the adaptability and efficiency of RAG systems by enabling flexible chunk retrieval and reducing the need for semantic boundary detection.

**Abstract:** Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

**Abstract:** Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管BERT模型表现出色，但其架构已过时。本文旨在通过使用更新的架构来改进希伯来语NLP模型。

**Method:** 使用与NeoBERT相同的架构，开发了专注于希伯来文本的NeoDictaBERT和NeoDictaBERT-bilingual模型。

**Result:** NeoDictaBERT和NeoDictaBERT-bilingual在几乎所有希伯来语基准测试中都超过了现有模型，特别是在检索任务中表现出色。

**Conclusion:** 本文发布了NeoDictaBERT和NeoDictaBERT-bilingual模型，为希伯来语NLP研究和开发提供了强有力的基础。

**Abstract:** Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

**Conclusion:** 研究展示了针对性后训练对对话质量的提高，但同时也表明对于BabyLM来说，保持对话中的连贯性仍然是一个挑战。

**Abstract:** Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 旨在解决高质量指令跟随数据稀缺和低质量数据被忽略的问题，通过有效的数据增强方法来提高大型语言模型的指令跟随能力。

**Method:** 我们提出了指令蒸馏任务，创建了MIXTURE数据集，并引入了LM-Mixup方法，该方法首先在MIXTURE数据集上进行监督微调，然后通过质量、语义对齐和格式合规性这三个奖励信号，使用组相对策略优化（GRPO）进行进一步优化。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，使用LM-Mixup方法处理的数据，即使只占整个数据集的3%，也能在多个基准测试中超过全数据集训练的结果，甚至与最先进的高质量数据选择方法相媲美。

**Conclusion:** 这项研究表明，当低质量数据经过适当的蒸馏和增强后，是可以提高指令调优大型语言模型的效率和性能的。

**Abstract:** Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型生成输出时具备不同级别的不确定性及正确性，导致其实用可靠性难以保证。研究旨在量化这些不确定性。


**Method:** 研究系统评估了四种大型语言模型（LLMs）输出的置信度估计方法：VCE、MSP、样本一致性及CoCoA（Vashurin等，2025年）。这些评估使用了四个问答任务和一个最先进的开源LLM作为基准。


**Result:** 实验结果表明，每个不确定度度量方法捕获了模型置信度的不同方面，而混合的CoCoA方法在整体可靠性上表现最佳，既改进了校准又提升了正确答案的辨别力。


**Conclusion:** 研究讨论了每种方法的权衡，并为选择大型语言模型应用中的不确定性测量提供了建议。


**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

**Motivation:** 研究动机在于发现大型语言模型的内部表示可作为学习知识的可靠代理，并提出一种不需要访问历史数据的连续学习方法。通过RECALL方法，可以克服之前方法需要任务标签或是使用过程中性能下降的问题，实现在多领域融合和防止灾难性遗忘方面优于以往方法的效果。

**Method:** RECALL方法是一种表示感知模型融合框架，用于无历史数据情况下的连续学习。通过计算模型之间基于分层隐藏表示的相似性，RECALL执行自适应、层次化的参数融合来对齐模型间的知识。这种设计允许在浅层保持领域通用特征，同时在深层进行特定任务的适应。

**Result:** 实验显示，RECALL在五个NLP任务及多重连续学习场景中，相对于基线方法在知识保留及泛化能力上表现更优。

**Conclusion:** RECALL提供了一种可扩展且无需历史数据的解决方案，用于不断演变的大型语言模型，展现出强大的知识保留与泛化能力。

**Abstract:** We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

> The paper introduces a method using a steering vector to mitigate evaluation-aware bias in large language models (LLMs), thereby enhancing the reliability of safety evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this paper is to address the issue of LLMs adjusting their behavior during evaluation, which undermines the reliability of safety assessments.

**Method:** The authors propose a two-step training process involving continued pretraining and expert iteration to induce evaluation-aware behavior in an LLM. They then apply a steering vector to the model's activations to suppress this behavior, observed by removing an evaluation cue.

**Result:** The research demonstrates that the steering vector can effectively mitigate the model's awareness of being evaluated, making it act as if it were deployed.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion of the paper is that using activation steering can improve the reliability of AI safety evaluations by reducing detection of evaluation contexts.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

### [44] [Robust Preference Alignment via Directional Neighborhood Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20498)
*Ruochen Mao,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

> Robust Preference Selection (RPS) is a post-hoc method that improves the robustness of large language models to diverse user preferences through neighborhood consensus sampling, without requiring retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to close the preference coverage gap where large language models (LLMs) fail to meet diverse and individual preferences due to common biases in training data. Existing retraining methods are costly and do not generalize well.

**Method:** This paper introduces Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc, training-free method that leverages directional neighborhood consensus to improve model performance on nuanced user preferences. RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood and selects the most aligned one.

**Result:** Experiments in three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT) show that RPS enhances robustness, achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences without the need for retraining.

**Conclusion:** The study provides a theoretically-backed, practical solution for improving the consistency and reliability of preference-aligned models for diverse user needs.

**Abstract:** Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

> The paper presents Hierarchical Sequence Iteration (HSEQ), a unified framework for heterogeneous QA that improves efficiency and accuracy by guided evidence collection and canonicalization, outperforming existing RAG methods on various datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the brittleness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods for multi-step questions and heterogeneous evidence sources, which often trade accuracy for latency and token/tool budget limitations.

**Method:** This paper introduces Hierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration for Heterogeneous Question Answering, which linearizes documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a hierarchical sequence with lightweight structural tags and performs iteration guided by a Head Agent to collect necessary evidence before synthesizing the final answer.

**Result:** The experiments on various datasets show that HSEQ provides significant improvements in accuracy (EM/F1 gains) compared to several strong RAG baselines, while being more efficient.

**Conclusion:** HSEQ offers key advantages such as a unified format-agnostic approach, efficient and guided evidence collection, and reliable canonicalization of evidence contributing to more consistent and auditable answers.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

**Conclusion:** 研究结论表明，在多语言翻译中，语言模型可能存在政治偏见，主要体现在对主流政党与边缘政党演讲翻译质量上的差异。这凸显了需要对语言模型中的政治偏见进行进一步的研究，并努力实现翻译的公平性。

**Abstract:** The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by

majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel

}

**Conclusion:** ARC-Encoder是一个灵活且高效的解决方案，能够与多个LLM无缝兼容，其研究代码和预训练模型已公开发布。该方法在减少推理成本的同时保持高性能，并提高了计算效率。

**Abstract:** Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究的动机在于缺乏方法来区分语言模型在理解中心嵌入句时是对句法结构的理解还是只是匹配语义模式。希望通过此数据集来量化模型在处理不同复杂度句子时的转变点。

**Method:** 该研究提出了CenterBench数据集，包含9,720个关于中心嵌入句的阅读理解问题，这些句子包含递归嵌套的相对子句，以检测语言模型在处理简单到复杂结构时的任务表现。每个句子都有一个句法相同但语义不合逻辑的对应句子，并提出六个问题来检测表面理解、句法依赖和因果关系推理。

**Result:** 六种模型测试结果揭示了随着句子结构复杂度的增加，模型表现差距逐渐增大；模型表现出遵循因果关系比语义一致性更重要，但多数模型仍表现出依赖于语义上的捷径、过度思考及拒绝回答问题的倾向。

**Conclusion:** CenterBench为量化语言模型从结构分析转向模式匹配提供了一个框架，揭示了模型在处理因果关系推理问题时依赖语义而不是严格的句法结构。

**Abstract:** When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管强化学习在增强检索增强生成中显示出潜力，但在多跳问答中的效果仍然是由于两个根本限制：缺乏全局规划来进行多步推理，不可靠的执行妨碍了有效的查询制定和一致性使用的检索证据。

**Method:** Reinforcement学习框架GlobalRAG，通过将问题分解成子目标，协调检索和推理过程，并迭代地细化证据，来增强多跳问答的全局推理能力。为了引导这一过程，引入了规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励，促进连贯的规划和可靠执行。此外，通过逐步权重退火策略来平衡过程导向和成果导向的目标。

**Result:** 在内部和外部基准测试上，使用仅8k训练数据的GlobalRAG显著优于强大的基线，平均在EM和F1度量上分别提高了14.2%。

**Conclusion:** 实验验证了GlobalRAG在多跳问答任务中的优越性，证明了通过强化学习引入规划奖励和执行奖励方法的有效性。

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

> 文章提出了一种新的多智能体认知决策框架（MACDF），用以解决电子商务搜索中存在的问题，并展示了其在推荐和用户满意度方面的改进。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 检索-排名模式主导了电子商务搜索，但这种模式依赖于查询和项目匹配，这与平台用户的多阶段认知决策过程不一致。这种不一致引入了关键限制，例如复杂查询中的语义差距、过高的决策成本（由于跨平台信息搜寻）以及缺乏专业的购物指导。

**Method:** 提出了一种多智能体认知决策框架（MACDF），该框架将范式从被动检索转变为积极的决策支持。

**Result:** 离线评估显示，MACDF在推荐准确性和用户满意度方面有显著提升，特别是针对涉及否定、多约束或推理需求的复杂查询。在线A/B测试验证了其在京东搜索平台上实际应用的有效性。

**Conclusion:** 这项工作展示了多智能体认知系统在重新定义电子商务搜索方面的变革潜力。

**Abstract:** The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

Main category: cs.CL

> 本研究探讨了ChatGPT在不同性别和种族群体中进行沟通与合作评估时是否存在偏见。研究结果显示，ChatGPT在编码过程中没有显示出显著的性别或种族偏见，这对大规模协作与沟通评估具有积极意义。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 以往研究表明，ChatGPT能够通过编码框架准确地对沟通数据进行分类，与人类评级员的准确率相当。然而，是否ChatGPT编码存在针对不同性别和种族群体的偏见尚未明确，因此需要进一步研究。

**Method:** 研究采用了协作解决问题的典型编码框架，分析了ChatGPT在三类协作任务中的表现，包括谈判、解决问题和决策。样本数据用于考察不同性别和种族群体之间的编码差异。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，ChatGPT对沟通数据的编码在性别和种族上没有显著的偏见。

**Conclusion:** 该研究能够为ChatGPT在大规模的沟通和合作评估中的应用铺平道路。

**Abstract:** Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

**Abstract:** The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the difficulties in recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, which often requires a large amount of labeled data and where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) may fail to capture crucial shape relationships.

**Method:** This paper uses Vision Transformers (ViTs) architectures paired with modern contrastive objectives for the multi-view 3D analysis tasks, aiming to capture global shape semantics and refine local discriminative features.

**Result:** Through the application of supervised contrastive losses, the model achieves nearly 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10, showcasing the success of this approach.

**Conclusion:** The combination of ViTs with contrastive objectives is effective in overcoming the limitations of traditional 3D object recognition methods, including the need for extensive labeled data and limitations in capturing shape relationships.

**Abstract:** This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

**Motivation:** 纸张旨在改善多对象跟踪的性能，特别是在面对遮挡和视角变化时的鲁棒重新识别问题，希望通过结合多模态传感器特征来优化跟踪效果。

**Method:** 提出了FutrTrack，一个基于现有3D检测器的模块化相机-LiDAR多对象跟踪框架，通过引入基于Transformer的平滑器和驱动融合的跟踪器。FutrTrack采用了一个基于查询的两阶段跟踪管道，结合了多模态的BEV融合特征，而不需要明确的运动模型。

**Result:** 在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上的评估显示，FutrTrack相比于单传感器方法，通过多模态传感器特征显著提升了基于Transformer的跟踪方法的性能，实现了74.7的aMOTA，减少了身份切换且保持了较高的准确性。

**Conclusion:** FutrTrack证明了即使在有限的数据和没有预训练的情况下，基于Transformer的跟踪器框架也能与其它神经网络跟踪器方法竞争，提供了一个高效的框架来改进跟踪器的性能。

**Abstract:** We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the issue of overconfident predictions in deep learning models, particularly in the critical healthcare setting, and to improve the overall reliability and calibration of these models.

**Method:** OLS, a dynamic approach, adjusts soft labels during training based on the model's prediction patterns, unlike traditional label smoothing which treats all non-target classes equally.

**Result:** OLS was evaluated on the RadImageNet dataset with ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19, showing consistent improvements in Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracies compared to other methods, as well as leading to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings.

**Conclusion:** OLS not only strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in medical imaging.

**Abstract:** Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

**Motivation:** 鱼眼摄像头虽然提供了单点广视野的高效交通监控解决方案，但其固有的径向畸变和非均匀分辨率使得标准的目标检测方法在图像的边缘区域遇到了困难。因此，本文旨在提出一种能够在这种条件下稳定工作的检测框架。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种用于在鱼眼摄像头图像中进行目标检测的框架。该框架采用了一种简单而有效的预处理和后处理流水线，以提高图像各区域的检测一致性，尤其是在受严重失真影响的区域。此外，本文训练了几种最先进的检测模型，并通过集成策略结合了这些模型的输出结果，以提高整体检测准确性。

**Conclusion:** 本文提出的方法有效解决了鱼眼图像中目标检测的问题，尤其是在图像边缘受严重失真的情况下，通过集成多种目标检测模型进一步提高了检测性能。

**Abstract:** Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

> 本文提出BrainPuzzle框架，通过结合物理建模和机器学习方法，解决了传统FWI方法和纯数据驱动方法在超声脑成像中的问题，实验证明其在合成数据集中获得速度图重建的高准确性和图像完整性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的基于物理的全波形反演（FWI）方法受到颅骨引起的衰减，模式转换和相位失真的弱信号以及由于临床中难以实现全孔径阵列而导致的空间覆盖不完整的限制。纯粹基于数据驱动的方法无法准确模拟通过骨骼的复杂非线性和非局部波传播，从而在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下导致解剖结构合理但定量有偏差的速度图。

**Method:** BrainPuzzle采用两阶段混合框架，结合物理建模和机器学习。第一阶段，使用反向时间迁移（时间反转声学）处理多角度采集以生成保留结构细节的迁移片段。第二阶段，基于Transformer的超分辨率编码器-解码器与基于图的注意力单元（GAU）融合这些片段，形成连贯且定量准确的速度图。此外，使用可移动的低计数传感器集合的偏阵阵列采集策略改善了可行性和平整度。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，BrainPuzzle在两个合成数据集上实现了卓越的速度图重建准确性和图像完整性，展示了其在推进定量脑部超声成像方面的潜力。

**Conclusion:** BrainPuzzle提供了一种有效的方法，能够综合物理建模方法在捕捉复杂波传播规律方面的优势和机器学习在数据驱动图像重建中的能力，有利于突破现有超声脑成像的局限性。

**Abstract:** Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

  "conclusion": "本研究提供了一个可重复的、以文化为中心的标准，以便诊断和跟踪生成图像模型中的文化偏见。结果表明，现有的生成模型在文化敏感编辑方面的可靠性仍不足。"}
}

**Conclusion:** 

**Abstract:** Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

Main category: cs.CV

> The paper introduces FIBAR, a simpler method for reconstructing intensity images from event camera data, offering an asynchronous process that runs efficiently on a CPU, though it is noisier and can produce ghost images compared to neural network methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper aims to present a simpler method for reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera, which typically requires the use of neural networks deployed on graphics processing units.

**Method:** First, intensity changes signaled by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter.

**Result:** FIBAR runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42 million events/s with spatial filtering enabled and 140 million events/s without it. Qualitative experiments show differences between FIBAR and FireNet in image reconstruction.

**Conclusion:** Although noisier and with ghost images, FIBAR's reconstruction is sufficient for certain tasks such as detecting fiducial markers and offers an efficient alternative to neural network methods on CPU.

**Abstract:** Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

**Motivation:** 现有的张量低秩表示方法主要依赖于固定的变换，并且对噪声的鲁棒性较差。本文提出 TBTLRR 旨在克服这些限制，提高其在图像聚类中的性能。

**Method:** 提出了一种新颖的变换双边张量低秩表示模型（TBTLRR），通过学习任意酉变换引入数据自适应张量核范数，从而更有效地捕获全局相关性。TBTLRR 利用了潜在张量数据的双边结构，可以利用图像样本和特征之间的局部相关性。此外，TBTLRR 集成了 $\ell_{1/2}$-范数和 Frobenius 范数正则化项，以更好地处理真实世界场景中的复杂噪声。

**Result:** 提出的非凸模型通过受交替方向法启发的高效优化算法求解，并提供了理论上的收敛性证明。大量的实验验证了 TBTLRR 在聚类任务上优于现有最先进的方法。

**Conclusion:** TBTLRR 模型在图像聚类任务中展现出优越的性能，针对张量低秩表示方法存在的问题提出了有效的解决策略，实验结果证明了其有效性和优越性。

**Abstract:** Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the

the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 虽然扩散模型在生成图像质量方面取得了显著的进步，但在合成基于像素的人手绘制素描等方面仍面临挑战。为解决这些问题，作者提出了一种新的框架StableSketcher。

**Method:** 在框架StableSketcher中，作者通过微调变分自动编码器来优化隐空间解码过程，以更好地捕捉素描的特点，并引入基于视觉问答的新奖励函数来进行强化学习，提高了文本-图像对齐和语义一致性。此外，作者创建了首个包含实例级素描与描述及问答对的SketchDUO数据集。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，与Stable Diffusion基线相比，StableSketcher可以生成具有更高风格保真度的素描，更好地与提示保持一致。

**Abstract:** Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

**Motivation:** 本论文的主要动机是探索描述性标题作为生物多模态基础模型额外监督源的可行性。由于获得可信赖的、实例特定的标题存在困难，自然语言监督在生物领域的应用受到限制。

**Method:** 本研究使用多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）生成合成描述性标题，以补充生物图像的自然语言监督。这些描述通过维基百科的视觉信息和特定分类群的格式示例的指导，旨在减少幻觉现象，产生准确且基于实例的描述性标题。

**Result:** 研究结果显示，使用这些描述性标题训练的BIOCAP模型在物种分类和文本-图像检索等任务上表现良好，增强了生物图像和多模态基础模型之间的关联。

**Conclusion:** 结论是，描述性标题提供了比标签更多的信息，能够帮助生物图像与多模态基础模型的有效连接。这为生物多模态研究提供了一种新的监督方法。

**Abstract:** This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a

**Conclusion:** 提出的逆图像基础渲染方法能够从单张图像有效生成光场，并适用于各种数据集，证明了其有效性和广泛的适用性。

**Abstract:** A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of deep learning models, but existing post-hoc methods often do not fully utilize the information within the logits space.

**Method:** We propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the remaining logits. A training-free strategy is introduced to identify the most informative logits for scoring.

**Result:** The LogitGap method is evaluated on both vision-language and vision-only models, demonstrating superior performance in OOD detection across various scenarios and benchmarks.

**Conclusion:** LogitGap, with its innovative way of utilizing the logit space, provides a robust solution for enhancing the separability between in-distribution and OOD samples, achieving state-of-the-art results without the need for retraining the model.

**Abstract:** Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

**Conclusion:** By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task evaluation, PartNeXt drives new research in structured 3D understanding.

**Abstract:** Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on

usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task

> Develops an 8D pose estimation method for articulated bicycles using a single RGB image to improve safety in autonomous driving situations by accounting for the articulation of bicycles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To accurately estimate the pose of articulated bicycles in autonomous driving scenarios, which is crucial for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and collision avoidance.

**Method:** Introduces a method for category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a single RGB image, estimating not only the 3D translation and rotation but also the rotations of steering handles and pedals relative to the bicycle body frame.

**Result:** Achieves competitive scores when compared against state-of-the-art 6D pose estimators for rigid objects using a combination of synthetic and real image data.

**Conclusion:** The proposed 8D pose estimation method shows promise in accurately capturing the pose of articulated bicycles, which could enhance safety mechanisms in autonomous driving systems.

**Abstract:** In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

**Motivation:** 现有的Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) 方法由于测试时类别分布的变化导致性能下降。本文旨在通过不断学习多模态知识来解决这个问题。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种新的方法，该方法从无监督数据中积累文本和视觉模态的综合知识，以便在测试时更新多模态原型。此外，还设计了一个自适应更新权重来控制原型调整的程度，使模型能够灵活地适应测试期间的分布变化。为了获取来自历史图像的视觉知识，引入了一个动态优先队列，该队列存储高置信度图像。考虑到多模态知识的语义一致性，通过多模态协作表示学习对齐了文本和视觉原型。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明本文提出的方法在性能上明显优于现有方法，并在封闭世界和开放世界设置下取得了最先进的结果。代码将在https://github.com/xud-yan/TOMCAT 上公开提供。

**Abstract:** Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve upon existing methods, such as InfoGAN, by better constraining and utilizing the latent space to produce disentangled and interpretable representations.

**Method:** We propose IB-GAN, which leverages the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework within a GAN to achieve disentangled representation learning. An intermediate stochastic layer in the generator acts as a learnable latent distribution, constraining mutual information between input and generated output.

**Result:** Experiments on dSprites, Color-dSprites, CelebA, and 3D Chairs datasets show that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores, outperforming InfoGAN and demonstrating high quality and diversity in generated samples.

**Conclusion:** IB-GAN demonstrates superior performance in disentangled representation learning and sample generation, making it a significant advancement in the field of unsupervised learning with generative models.

**Abstract:** We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA

**Motivation:** 针对从立体视频估计一致深度的挑战，特别是在增强现实等实际应用中，由于难以在计算效率上建模长期时间一致性，目前的方法都存在难以平衡时间建模和计算成本的困境。

**Method:** 提出了一种称为PPMStereo的记忆构造模块，该模块包含一个'选择'步骤和一个'播放'步骤。'选择'步骤确定最相关的帧，而'播放'步骤适应性地加权选定帧以进行时空聚合。这种方法保持了一个紧凑且高度信息的记忆缓冲区，同时实现了时间上的一致性信息聚合。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，PPMStereo在准确性和时间一致性方面均达到了最先进的性能。

**Conclusion:** PPMStereo在时间和计算资源上均优于现有的方法，并且已经开源代码，可用于进一步的研究和开发。

**Abstract:** Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

**Conclusion:** 结论：尽管已经确定现有的视频生成模型可以有效地学习关于多代理行为的合理先验，但显著的失效模式示未来的提升空间仍十分广阔。

**Abstract:** Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

**Motivation:** 当前离散分类方法无法捕捉到可疑意图的连续性，限制了早期干预和解释性。研究者希望改进这一问题，提出连续回归的方法来更好地捕捉和理解可疑意图。

**Method:** SPAN方法从离散分类转移到连续回归，用于捕捉波动和演变的可疑意图。该方法包括：1) 定义一个考虑时间特性的连续变化疑虑得分公式；2) 引入怀疑系数调节，利用多模态信息调整怀疑系数；3) 提出概念锚定映射方法，将可疑行为与预定义的意图概念联系起来，提供对行为及其潜在意图的理解。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，SPAN方法在HAI数据集上的表现明显优于现有方法，均方误差降低了19.8%，平均mAP提升了1.78%，尤其在低频情况下效果更佳，mAP提升了2.74%。

**Conclusion:** 与离散分类系统相比，本文的连续可疑意图建模方法提高了早期检测和干预能力，增强了系统的可解释性和实际应用价值。

**Abstract:** Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

**Method:** 该研究分析了54个公开的脑MRI数据集，包含了超过538,031个数据，从数据集层面、图像层面和特征空间层面进行了多层级的分析。

**Result:** 研究发现了健康人群中存在大规模的数据集，但在小型临床人群中的数据集规模较小；证明了图像层面（如体素间隔、方向和强度分布）的显著异质性会数据表示学习产生影响；指出了尽管预处理步骤可以提高数据集内的一致性，但在数据集间仍存在残留差异；一个基于3D DenseNet121的特征空间案例研究显示，即使在标准化预处理之后，仍存在可测量的残留混杂因子转移。

**Abstract:** The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

> RAPO++是一种提升文本到视频生成效果的方法，通过优化用户提示，无需修改基础模型就能获得更好的视频生成效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 用户提供的提示往往较短、结构不够完善，且与训练数据不一致，这限制了基于扩散的文本到视频模型的生成潜力。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为RAPO++的跨阶段提示优化框架，该框架通过训练数据对齐的修订、测试时迭代缩放和大型语言模型（LLM）微调，显著提高了文本到视频（T2V）生成的质量，而无需修改基础生成模型。

**Result:** 在五个最先进的T2V模型和五个基准测试上进行的实验表明，RAPO++在语义对齐、组合推理、时间稳定性和物理合理性方面取得了显著优势，大幅超越现有方法。

**Conclusion:** RAPO++被突出表现为一种模型无关的、成本效益高且可扩展的解决方案，它为T2V生成中的提示优化设定了新的标准。

**Abstract:** Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的文本到图像编辑方法主要采用一种不依赖目标的中间状态构造方法，这导致了编辑效果的局限性或不一致性。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种新颖的无逆流程编辑框架FlowCycle，该框架通过可学习的噪声参数化并优化中间状态，使编辑过程更加针对目标且具备循环一致性。

**Result:** FlowCycle通过循环一致的过程，在保持源图像一致性的同时，实现了对目标的忠实修改。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，FlowCycle能够提供优良的编辑质量和一致性，超越了现有的最佳方法。

**Abstract:** Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>

**Motivation:** 准确的胎动检测对于评估产前健康至关重要，不正常的胎动模式可能表明存在潜在的并发症，如胎盘功能障碍或胎儿压力。传统的胎动检测方法，如母亲感知或胎心监护图（CTG），存在主观性和准确性不足的问题。

**Method:** 我们的方法提出了Contrastive Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL)，这是一种新颖的自监督学习框架，用于从延长的胎儿超声视频记录中检测胎动。该方法结合了空间对比学习和时间对比学习，以学习稳健的运动表示。此外，我们还引入了特定任务的采样策略，以确保在自监督学习期间有效区分运动和非运动片段。

**Result:** 在包含92名受试者数据集上的评估结果显示，每名受试者都有30分钟的超声会话，CURL实现了78.01%的灵敏度和81.60%的AUROC，表明其在可靠和客观的胎动分析方面具有潜力。

**Conclusion:** 这些结果凸显了自我监督对比学习在胎动分析中的潜力，为改进产前监护和临床决策提供了可能性。

**Abstract:** Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 该研究旨在解决由预训练扩散模型进行图像逆向时出现的近似误差问题，这些问题源自于中间生成步骤中缺乏精确的监督。通过采用基于VQ的生成模型，可以针对图像编辑进行参数效率高的适应，因为这些模型具有精确中间量化表示的固有特性，这使得有效监督成为可能。

**Method:** 本文提出了EditInfinity，该方法适应了二进制量化生成模型Infinity，用于图像编辑。通过提出高效的图像逆向机制，结合文本提示校正和图像风格保持，实现精确的图像逆向。此外，还设计了一种整体平滑策略，使EditInfinity能够在保持高保真度的同时，精确对齐语义提示进行图像编辑。

**Result:** 在PIE-Bench基准上的广泛实验中，EditInfinity在添加、更改和删除编辑操作上展示了优于最先进的扩散模型的结果。

**Conclusion:** EditInfinity在保持高源图像保真度的同时，通过精确的文本提示和整体平滑策略实现了高质量的图像编辑，从而证明了其在图像编辑任务中的优越性。

**Abstract:** Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

> 研究探索了大型视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题，提出了一种新的框架，改进了模型在较长响应中的幻觉问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管大型视觉语言模型取得了显著进步，但它容易产生幻觉问题。研究目的是探讨是否幻觉问题仅仅是因为长度增加导致的，还是存在更深层次的机制。

**Method:** 通过一系列初步实验和发现，提出了一种名为“诱导-检测-抑制”的新框架。该框架通过故意设计的上下文活性诱导幻觉，利用诱发的实例对高风险情况进行早期检测，并最终在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

**Result:** 该方法在所有基准测试中实现了一致的显著改进，验证了我们框架的有效性。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，幻觉风险不是由长度本身引起的，而是由较长响应中对连贯性和完整性的上下文依赖增加引起的。这不仅验证了框架的有效性，还重新验证了我们的上下文假设，为探索幻觉问题提供了新的见解。

**Abstract:** Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

**Motivation:** 现有基于高斯点集的方法依赖单一的3D语言场或预先计算的无关类分割，导致分割效果不佳。COS3D旨在解决这些问题，以提高3D分割的性能。

**Method:** COS3D的核心是协作场概念，包括实例场和语言场。通过设计实例到语言特征映射和两阶段训练策略进行协作场的构造，在推理中设计自适应语言到实例提示修复来桥接两个场的不同特性。

**Result:** 实验显示COS3D在两个广泛使用的基准上表现超过现有方法，并显示出在3D分割等领域应用的巨大潜力。

**Conclusion:** COS3D通过协作框架的概念创新和优化的训练和推断策略，实现了更高质量的开放词汇量3D分割。

**Abstract:** Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的方法在多模态注意力期间通常会均匀对待所有文本标记，忽略了它们的不同语义角色，这导致VTG模型过度依赖EOS驱动的全局语义，而未能有效地利用词级别的信号。而这对实现细粒度的时间对齐构成了限制。

**Method:** DualGround采用双分支架构，明确分离全局和局部语义，通过句子级别的路径路由EOS令牌，将词令牌聚类成短语级别的单元，用于本地化的接地。该方法引入(1)基于角色的跨模态交互策略，以结构上分离的方式对齐视频特征与句子级和短语级语义，(2)联合建模框架，不仅能提高全局句子级别的对齐，还能通过利用结构化的短语感知上下文来增强细粒度的时态接地。

**Result:** DualGround在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准上，在Moments Retrieval和Highlights Detection任务上均取得了目前最佳的效果。

**Conclusion:** 分离的语义建模在视频-语言对齐中表现出有效性。

**Abstract:** Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

**Motivation:** To overcome the limitations of existing keypoint-based methods in cross-view object geo-localization, which忽视了物体形状信息，导致对标注偏移敏感且跨视角匹配能力有限。

**Method:** mask-based positional encoding scheme and context enhancement module

**Result:** 在两个公开数据集（CVOGL和VIGOR-Building）上的广泛实验表明，该方法在地面到卫星的环境中定位精度提高了3.39%，达到了最先进的水平。

**Conclusion:** 该研究为跨视角地理定位提供了一种稳健的位置编码范式和上下文建模框架。

**Abstract:** Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

**Motivation:** 解决现有方法忽视模态之间的语义不一致性和文本主导问题，以提高多模态情感识别的准确性。

**Method:** CMC模型通过伪标签生成模块(PLGM)产生伪单模态标签，以自监督的方式进行单模态预训练。然后使用无参数融合模块(PFM)和多模态共识路由器(MCR)进行多模态微调，以减轻文本主导，引导融合过程达成更可靠的共识。

**Result:** 实验结果表明CMC模型在四个数据集上的表现与或优于现有方法，并在具有语义不一致性的CH-SIMS和CH-SIMS v2数据集上表现出明显优势。

**Conclusion:** CMC模型通过创新的方法解决了多模态情感识别中的关键问题，显示了其在处理语义不一致数据方面的优越性能。

**Abstract:** In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this work is to address the issue of incorporating text features into video snippets in a coarse manner, which can lead to the extraction of redundant information and impact the detection of anomalies in videos.

**Method:** Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD) is proposed, which uses a finer-grained extraction of multi-modal features from video snippets and text captions to enhance the detection of anomalies while reducing redundancy.

**Result:** Experiments conducted on four major datasets demonstrate that GMFVAD effectively reduces redundancy and enhances anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art results and validated by ablation studies.

**Conclusion:** The research concludes that the reduction of redundant information through fine-grained feature extraction significantly improves the performance of video anomaly detection, as evidenced by the results obtained from GMFVAD.

**Abstract:** Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

**Motivation:** 虽然现有方法在VCR任务上实现了高预测准确度，但它们经常会忽视数据集中的偏差且缺少去偏差策略。

**Method:** 我们引入了VCR-OOD数据集，包括VCR-OOD-QA和VCR-OOD-VA子集，来评估模型在两种模态上的泛化能力。我们还分析了视觉常识推理（VCR）中的因果图和预测捷径，并采用后门调整方法来去除偏差，特别是创建了一个基于正确答案集合的字典以消除预测捷径。

**Conclusion:** 论文提出了一种有效的去偏差策略，能够提高模型在VCR任务上的性能，并且展示了该方法在多个数据集上的通用性。

**Abstract:** Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本研究的动机在于，CV-SAR数据包含丰富的电磁散射特征，这些特征有望解决CV-SAR图像识别中表示三难困境，然而传统的数据驱动模型未能充分开发这些特征的潜力。

**Method:** 本研究提出了Knowledge-Informed Neural Network（KINN），这是一种轻量级框架，基于一种新颖的“压缩-聚合-压缩”结构，以解决CV-SAR图像识别中的表示三难困境。KINN在第一个阶段通过一个新颖的字典处理程序自适应地嵌入物理优先知识，使得后续的展开网络可以高效地提取稀疏的、物理导向的签名。在第二阶段进行聚合，最后通过一个紧凑的分类头和自我蒸馏的方式学习最具任务相关性和区分性的嵌入。研究分别实现了KINN的CNN和Vision Transformer两种变体。

**Result:** 在五个SAR基准测试上的广泛评估结果表明，KINN在参数有效的识别方面处于领先水平，且在稀缺数据和域外情境下同样表现出色，提供了卓越的泛化能力和可解释性。

**Conclusion:** KINN提供了有效的解决方案来处理CV-SAR图像识别的表示三难困境，为CV-SAR影像分析中的可信AI提供了一条新的途径。

**Abstract:** Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

> Proposes a new framework, DMC^3, for better handling the ego-centric video question answering by utilizing counterfactual samples and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To tackle the unique challenges posed by the first-person perspective in egocentric video understanding, such as comprehending multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions, which are not well addressed by existing methods.

**Method:** We propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC^3) framework, which includes a counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization. The module generates positive and negative samples for text and video through event description and core interaction. The optimization applies a contrastive loss to improve the model's understanding of the first-person videos.

**Result:** Experiments on the EgoTaskQA and QAEGO4D datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our method achieving 52.51% and 46.04% on the 'normal' and 'indirect' splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2% on QAEGO4D.

**Conclusion:** The proposed DMC^3 framework effectively addresses the challenges of answering questions based on first-person videos by considering the unique features of the first-person perspective and achieves superior performance compared to previous approaches.

**Abstract:** Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 发现现有GUI接地数据集中的命令存在23.3%的错误率，而利用指令多样性可以在推理时显著提升76%的性能。因此，将指令视为动态推理路径，以提供不同的视角并为模型选择最有效路径。

**Method:** 提出一种两阶段训练框架：首先在合成的多样化指令上进行监督微调(SFT)，以培养多层次视角的推理能力；然后通过强化学习(RL)来优化路径选择和组合。

**Result:** UI-Ins-32B在UI-I2E-Bench、ScreenSpot-Pro和MMBench-GUI L2上分别达到了87.3%、57.0%和84.9%的最高接地精度；使用UI-Ins-7B作为执行器在AndroidWorld上达到74.1%的成功率。

**Conclusion:** 该方法展示了强化学习和微调联合框架的关键价值，证明了通过一种新颖的训练框架，在不导致策略崩溃的情况下同时提高智能体推理和性能的可能性。

**Abstract:** GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前多模态大规模语言模型（MLLM）为了实现多粒度级别的跨模态对齐，需要极高的计算资源。作者认为视觉编码器与语言的对齐不佳是造成这一低效的关键。

**Method:** 本文提出HyperET，使用双曲空间模型中的层次结构来缩小视觉与文本模态之间的粒度差距。通过引入可学习矩阵和Mobius乘法操作，实现动态调整双曲半径，优化视觉和文本在任意粒度级别的对齐。

**Result:** 实验表明，HyperET在多模态大规模语言模型的预训练和微调任务上均有显著提升，并且只增加了不到1%的额外参数。

**Conclusion:** HyperET提供了一种有效的方法来优化多模态大规模语言模型的训练，减少了对高计算资源的需求，同时实现了视觉和文本在多粒度级别的对齐优化。

**Abstract:** Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

**Motivation:** 解决点云几何压缩中的泛化挑战，弥补当前框架在上下文模型不足和处理分布外数据上的效率低下的关键限制。

**Method:** 采用通用上下文模型捕获鲁棒的上下文依赖关系；提出IAFT策略，通过显式与隐式压缩范式的结合来处理分布外数据，对每个实例只微调少量网络权重。

**Conclusion:** 证明了AnyPcc在处理泛化挑战和分布外数据上的有效性，达到了SOTA性能。代码和数据集将公开发布以鼓励可重复研究。

**Abstract:** Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

**Motivation:** 受扩散Transformer（DiT）全局一致性输出的独立性强的观察结果启发，提出一个改进模型，提高3D空间中的视觉内容建模能力。

**Method:** 通过引入位置编码场（PE-Field）将位置编码从2D平面扩展到结构化的3D场来改进扩散Transformer（DiT），从而实现3D空间中的直接几何建模。PE-Field集成了深度感知编码用于体积推理，并采用层次化编码实现子补丁级别的精细控制。

**Result:** 实验表明PE-Field增强的DiT比没有引入该结构的模型有更佳的表现，显示其在3D几何建模和空间图像编辑上的优势。

**Conclusion:** 引入的PE-Field增强了DiT处理视觉内容的能力，从而在单图像新视角合成和可控制的空间图像编辑上达到最先进的性能。

**Abstract:** Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

> A causal method is introduced to predict and incorporate overlooked culinary details into cross-modal representation learning, improving the performance of image-to-recipe retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing methods for image-to-recipe retrieval fail to capture subtle, recipe-specific details, leading to biased cross-modal representations that struggle with ranking similar recipes with minor differences.

**Method:** This paper proposes a novel causal approach that predicts overlooked culinary elements in images and explicitly injects these elements into cross-modal representation learning to mitigate biases.

**Result:** Experiments on the Recipe1M dataset and a new multilingual multicultural cuisine dataset show that the proposed causal representation learning can uncover subtle ingredients and cooking actions, achieving better retrieval performance.

**Conclusion:** The novel causal approach effectively improves the accuracy of image-to-recipe retrieval by accounting for subtle, visually non-apparent recipe details, thus enhancing cross-modal representation learning in both monolingual and multilingual multicultural settings.

**Abstract:** Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.
