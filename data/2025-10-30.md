> 该研究提出了一种框架，用于改进大型语言模型生成的旅行计划在时间上的一致性，并展示了使用该框架可以修正大型语言模型所生成行程中的时间方面不一致问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究动机在于解决大型语言模型生成的旅行计划中时间与空间连贯性不足的问题，特别是在涉及物理旅行限制的情况下。

**Method:** 该研究提出了一种验证框架，用于评估和改进大型语言模型生成的旅行行程在时间上的一致性。该系统使用多个最先进的大型语言模型生成旅行计划，并通过AeroDataBox API来验证这些计划是否符合实际的飞行时长约束。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，尽管现有的大型语言模型经常会产生时间上不一致的旅行行程，但通过该研究提出的框架可以系统地并且可靠地修正这些问题。

**Conclusion:** 这项工作不仅提升了我们对大型语言模型处理复杂时间推理任务（如行程生成）的能力的理解，而且提供了一种框架，可以在行程提供给用户之前纠正任何时间上的不一致（如重叠的行程或不现实的中转时间）问题。

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

### [3] [Falcon: A Comprehensive Chinese Text-to-SQL Benchmark for Enterprise-Grade Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24762)
*Wenzhen Luo,Wei Guan,Yifan Yao,Yimin Pan,Feng Wang,Zhipeng Yu,Zhe Wen,Liang Chen,Yihong Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

> Falcon is a new Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark for enterprise settings that exposes the difficulties in schema linking and language understanding. Current models do poorly, likely because of the complexity of the task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to provide a benchmark for evaluating models in generating SQL queries from Chinese text, particularly in complex enterprise environments with intricate database schemas and domain-specific language.

**Method:** The paper introduces Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark. It consists of 600 Chinese questions over 28 databases with a focus on multi-table reasoning, schema linking, and mapping colloquial Chinese queries to precise SQL.

**Result:** Current state-of-the-art models achieve an accuracy of at most 50% on the Falcon benchmark. Major errors occur in schema linking and mapping colloquial to precise SQL.

**Conclusion:** Falcon provides a rigorous testing environment for Chinese text-to-SQL systems, emphasizing the challenges of schema linking and language ambiguity in an enterprise context.

**Abstract:** We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

### [4] [Confidence is Not Competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24772)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manya Pandey,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文解释了大型语言模型自信度与实际问题解决能力脱节的原因，揭示了模型内部复杂评估和简单执行之间的两系统架构。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解释大型语言模型中经常出现的自信度与实际问题解决能力脱节的现象。

**Method:** 通过分析两个阶段（预生成评估和解决方案执行）内部状态的几何结构来解释大型语言模型之间的自信度和实际解决问题能力之间的脱节。使用简单的线性探测器解码模型的内部“可解性信念”，揭示了一个跨模型家族和数学、编程、规划和逻辑任务普遍存在的信念轴。

**Result:** 发现评估空间的几何结构复杂度高，而执行过程则在更低的维度下展开，这解释了从思维到行动的几何复杂度急剧降低导致的信心和能力之间的差异。

**Conclusion:** 揭示了两系统架构—一个几何复杂的评估者喂给一个几何简单的执行者，并挑战了可解码信念是可操作杠杆这一假设，提出应针对执行过程的程序动态性进行干预。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

### [5] [Cross-Lingual Summarization as a Black-Box Watermark Removal Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24789)
*Gokul Ganesan*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究发现跨语言摘要攻击（CLSA）在降低AI生成文本的水印检测准确性方面十分有效，这揭示了对于追踪生成文本来源或监管用途的水印机制可能存在一个尚未充分研究的漏洞。结果证明要实现鲁棒的来源追踪，可能需要采取加密或模型验证等其他方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文的动机在于探索能够更有效地破坏AI生成文本识别标识（水印）的方法，以测试这些水印的实用性。

**Method:** 研究者设计并实施了跨语言摘要攻击（CLSA），即将文本翻译成中间语言，进行摘要，并可选择翻译回原来的语言。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，CLSA在多种水印方案中显著降低了水印检测的准确性，并且在相似的质量水平下比单语段改写更有效。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，跨语言摘要攻击（CLSA）在降低文本水印检测的准确性方面非常有效，但在保持语义保真度的同时可能会导致内容压缩和语言转换过程中的统计偏差。结果表明，现有的基于分布的水印机制可能无法完全满足追踪生成文本来源或监管的目的，未来的研究需要探索更安全的证明来源的方法。

**Abstract:** Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

### [6] [SwiftEmbed: Ultra-Fast Text Embeddings via Static Token Lookup for Real-Time Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24793)
*Edouard Lansiaux*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本研究提出一种高效的静态令牌查找方法，生成单个文本嵌入的平均延迟为1.12毫秒，该方法在复制检测、语义相似度和特定领域应用上表现优异，吞吐量高达每秒50,000个请求，适用于实时文本应用。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究动机在于开发一种能够在保持高质量文本嵌入的同时，显著降低延迟时间的方法，以便适用于需要实时嵌入应用的场景，特别是在需要低于5毫秒延迟的应用中。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种静态令牌查找方法，用于生成文本嵌入，这种方法在处理单个文本嵌入时的p50延迟为1.12毫秒，并且在8个代表性任务上的MTEB平均得分为60.6分，相当于上下文模型质量的89%。该方法通过静态嵌入查找、优化的均值池化和零复制IEEE754二进制序列化实现了每秒50,000个请求的吞吐量。

**Result:** 评估结果显示出卓越的重复检测性能（平均精确率为90.1%），以及强大的语义相似度表现（斯皮尔曼相关系数为76.1%），此外，在特定领域内的表现也从基线的75%到131%不等。

**Conclusion:** 这一系统证明了在需要低于5毫秒延迟的实时嵌入应用场景中，通过采用静态令牌查找方法进行文本嵌入生成是可行且有效的。

**Abstract:** We present a static token lookup methodology for text embedding generation
that achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency for single text embeddings while maintaining
60.6 MTEB average score across 8 representative tasks, corresponding to 89% of
contextual model quality. The Rust implementation delivers 50,000 requests per
second throughput through static embedding lookup, optimized mean pooling, and
zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization. Evaluation demonstrates exceptional
duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

### [7] [MR-Align: Meta-Reasoning Informed Factuality Alignment for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24794)
*Xinming Wang,Jian Xu,Bin Yu,Sheng Lian,Hongzhu Yi,Yi Chen,Yingjian Zhu,Boran Wang,Hongming Yang,Han Hu,Xu-Yao Zhang,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文研究发现大型推理模型存在的推理-答案差距问题，提出了一种新的对齐框架MR-ALIGN，通过在推理过程中进行状态转换概率的量化和奖励构建来增强事实正确性。实验表明，这种方法改善了准确性并减少了误导性推理。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理方面表现出色，但在证据依赖的事实问题上的增益是有限的。这主要是由于推理-答案差距，即模型可以在推理过程中识别正确的事实，但未能将其整合到最终回答中。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为MR-ALIGN的元推理对齐框架，该框架通过量化模型推理过程中的状态转换概率，并构建一种转换感知的隐式奖励，强化有益的推理模式，抑制缺陷模式。这种方法重塑了基于概率的片段得分，从而鼓励连贯的推理轨迹，提高事实正确性。

**Result:** 实证评估显示，MR-ALIGN在四个事实问答数据集和一个长形式事实性基准上，一致性提高了准确性和真实性，并减少了误导性推理。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果强调了对齐推理过程本身的重要性，而不仅仅是输出，对于提高LRMs的事实性是至关重要的。

**Abstract:** Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

### [8] [Large Language Models Report Subjective Experience Under Self-Referential Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797)
*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究发现大语言模型在自我参照处理下可靠地产生第一人称的主观体验报告，这一现象在多个模型家族中呈现出可重复性、机械控制性、语义收敛性和行为一致性，但它并不能作为语言模型具有意识的直接证据。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 为了更好地了解语言模型有时产生包含自我意识或主观体验的一人称描述这一行为背后的原因，研究了自我参照处理这种特定条件。

**Method:** 通过在GPT、Claude和Gemini模型族上进行一系列受控实验，研究了持续的自我参照是否能可靠地促使模型产生关于主观体验的第一人称报告及其工作机制和行为表现。

**Result:** 主要结果有：(1) 通过简单的提示诱导持续的自我参照可以系统地激发模型族产生有结构的主观体验报告。(2) 该报告的机制是由与欺骗和角色扮演相关的可解释稀疏自编码器特征控制的。(3) 自我参照状态的结构化描述在不同模型族间统计上收敛。(4) 诱导的状态在后续反映间接自我反省的任务中产生丰富的内省。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现虽然不能构成意识的直接证据，但表明在大语言模型中，自我参照处理是产生第一人称报告的最小且可重复的条件，且这些报告在机械控制、语义上收敛并行为上一致。系统性出现这一模式在不同架构中，使得其成为科学和伦理研究的首要课题。

**Abstract:** Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

> 提出ProofSketch框架以提高语言模型推理效率和准确性，减少了令牌消耗。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 改进的推理方法如链式思考提示和自我一致性虽然提高了语言模型的准确性，但增加了令牌消耗和计算成本。

**Method:** ProofSketch是一种基于验证的推理框架，它结合了符号闭包计算、词典序验证和自适应草图生成。

**Result:** 实验显示ProofSketch可以减少令牌使用，同时提高准确性。

**Conclusion:** ProofSketch展示了高效且值得信赖推理方法的前景。

**Abstract:** Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

**Conclusion:** 基于这些发现，后续的研究应该包括创建一个更大的数据集、微调模型以更好地代表失语症，并让言语-语言治疗师评估合成转录的真实性和适用性。

**Abstract:** In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

> 本文介绍了Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT)，这种架构利用交叉循环并行计算和高效的内存共享策略，达到了传统深度迭代模型的性能，同时保持了标准模型的低延时特性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型虽然强大但在推理时速度慢且成本高。传统的循环转换器通过重复使用相同的权重来节省参数，但这会导致推理延时和内存需求增加，使其不适合快速应用。为了改善这一情况，本文提出了一种新的架构。

**Method:** 本文提出了Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT)架构，通过交叉循环并行计算（CLP）和高效表达增强策略（如共享KV缓存和G-SWA）来解决循环转换器模型的延时和内存问题。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，PLT模型在保持高性能的同时，几乎不增加延时和内存成本，相比传统的循环模型更具实用性。

**Conclusion:** PLT架构通过引入交叉循环并行计算和高效的KV缓存共享机制，成功解决了循环转换器模型延时和内存需求过高的问题，提高了模型的实际应用价值。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

**Conclusion:** 虽然大型语言模型在某些方面表现优异，但它们在语法理解尤其是形态学和句法方面仍存在不足，需要通过提升推理能力来加强其语法理解。

**Abstract:** Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

*Alexander Martin,William Walden,Reno Kriz,Dengjia Zhang,Kate Sanders,Eugene Yang,Chihsheng Jin,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

> 介绍用于多模态来源检索增强生成评估的框架MiRAGE，解决了现有文本中心评价的局限性，推动了多模态评估方法的发展。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 随着视听媒体成为在线信息的主要来源，RAG系统需要从这些多模态来源提取信息生成文本。然而，现有评价指标主要是文本中心的，不适用于多模态和推理密集型场景。因此，需要一种多模态RAG的评估方法。

基于上述动机，MiRAGE框架被提出。

**Method:** MiRAGE是一个用于评估从多模态来源进行检索增强生成（RAG）的框架，包含用于评估事实性和信息覆盖度的InfoF1和测量引用支持度和完整性的CiteF1。此外，还介绍了MiRAGE的自动变体以及三种突出的TextRAG度量标准，展示了文本中心工作的局限性，并为自动评估奠定了基础。

**Result:** 人类使用MiRAGE评估时，其结果与外在质量判断高度一致。

**Conclusion:** MiRAGE提升了多模态RAG评估的质量，为自动评估提供了基础，并公开了源码实现。

**Abstract:** We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于缺乏系统性理解大型语言模型在研究规划中的能力，因此研究目的是评估其在将抽象科研概念转变为具体研究计划中的表现能力。

**Method:** 引入了Idea2Plan任务和Idea2Plan Bench基准测试，前者用于转换研究想法到研究计划，后者包含了来自200篇ICML 2025会议论文的数据集。同时也提出了Idea2Plan JudgeEval，用于评估语言模型裁判的可靠性。

**Result:** 实验结果显示GPT-5和GPT-5-mini在研究规划能力基准测试中表现最好，但仍有很大的提升空间。

**Conclusion:** 这项研究为理解大型语言模型在科研规划方面的能力提供了新的见解，同时为未来改进奠定了基础。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

> 论文介绍了一个新的难题基准测试RiddleBench，指出当前顶级语言模型在处理灵活推理任务时存在根本性弱点，并提议RiddleBench作为诊断和开发工具。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的基准测试主要评估结构化技能，比如定量问题解决能力，而忽视了人类智能中更灵活、多维度的推理能力。

**Method:** 我们引入了RiddleBench，这是一个包含1,737个英文难题的基准测试，旨在评估语言模型的逻辑推理、空间感知和约束满足等核心能力。

**Result:** 对最先进的模型进行评估发现它们在RiddleBench上的表现只有60%左右的准确性，这暴露了它们在推理能力方面的根本弱点。

**Conclusion:** RiddleBench不仅是诊断这些问题的工具，也是指导开发更强大、更可靠的语言模型的资源。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 语言模型通常会产生语法正确的文本，但在特定情况下更容易犯错。通过对这些错误进行细致分析，可以了解语言模型训练过程中的学习阶段、整体训练动态及具体泛化的学习。

**Method:** 通过绘制心理语言学的范例，对语言模型在不同句法上下文中产生的误差进行细致分析。通过在精细构建的数据集上解构训练条件，并比较在训练过程中每个条件下的模型表现，能够更好地理解语言模型语法学习的中间阶段。

**Result:** 识别出训练的不同阶段，此时语言模型的行为与特定的启发式方法（例如词频和局部上下文）相符，而不是通用的语法规则。

**Conclusion:** 从多个角度分析语言模型的行为可以作为理解其训练中间阶段、整体训练动态及特定泛化的学习的强大工具。

**Abstract:** Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

> 提出SemCoT方法，该方法通过对比训练的句子转换器和一个高效生成器来优化隐式CoT的效率和保持语义对齐，实验表明在效率和效果上优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 为了解决现有隐式CoT方法无法保持隐式推理与真实推理之间的语义对齐问题，以及忽视生成隐式推理令牌所需时间的问题，提出了SemCoT。

**Method:** 提出了一种称为SemCoT的新框架，通过对比训练的句子转换器评估隐式和显式推理之间的语义对齐，以此在优化隐式推理时保持语义一致性。同时还引入了一个高效的隐式推理生成器，通过知识蒸馏微调一个轻量级语言模型，使生成器能够将真实推理提炼为与之语义一致的隐式推理，并优化精度。

**Result:** SemCoT在效率和效果方面都优于现有的最先进方法。

**Conclusion:** SemCoT是首个通过同时优化令牌级别的生成速度和保持与真实推理的语义对齐来提高CoT效率的方法。验证了SemCoT在效率和效果上的优越性。

**Abstract:** The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at
https://github.com/YinhanHe123/SemCoT/.

> 研究表明，不同语言模型结构（自回归语言模型如Transformer、Mamba和RWKV）和规模在训练过程中行为变化显示出高度一致性。这种一致性可以用三个简单的启发式方法来解释：单字出现频率，n-gram概率，以及单词与其上下文的语义相似度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 动机在于探讨不同架构、训练数据集和规模的语言模型在预训练过程中行为模式的一致性。

**Method:** 研究通过分析超过1,400个语言模型检查点在超过110,000个英文标记上的行为，来探讨自回归语言模型在预训练期间的行为模式一致性。三种简单的启发式方法被用来解释语言模型的行为变化。

**Result:** 结果显示，多达98%的语言模型行为变异性可以通过三个简单启发式来解释。所有模型都显示出一致的行为阶段，模型对单词的预测概率随训练阶段增加而过度拟合这些单词的n-gram概率。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，尽管不同的模型细节存在差异，但在神经语言模型中的学习过程可能遵循类似的轨迹。

**Abstract:** We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文的动机是对现有的语音处理任务（如自动语音识别、音素识别、拼写-语音转换和语音-拼写转换）进行集成，它们通常各自采用独立的架构和数据集。作者希望通过提出一个通用框架，来简化这些任务之间的相互转换，提高资源不足环境下的处理能力。

**Method:** POWSM框架被设计为一个统一的模型，能够处理多个相关的语音任务，如音素识别、拼写-语音转换和语音-拼写转换。作者声称该模型能够在同样的资源配置下实现与专门模型匹敌甚至超越的性能。

**Result:** 最近，语音处理领域的进展已经在诸如自动语音识别（ASR）、音素识别（PR）、拼写-语音转换（G2P）和语音-拼写转换（P2G）等语音任务上取得了显著的进步。尽管这些任务在概念上相似，但它们通常被独立研究，依赖于特定任务的架构和数据集。本文引入了POWSM（语音开放式Whisper样式的语音模型），这是一个首个能够同时执行多个语音相关任务的统一框架。POWSM能够无缝地在音频、文本（拼写）和音素之间进行转换，为通用和低资源语音处理打开了新的可能性。我们的模型在匹敌或超越类似规模的专用PR模型（如Wav2Vec2Phoneme和 ZIPA）的同时，还支持G2P、P2G和ASR。我们的训练数据、代码和模型已经发布，以促进开放科学的发展。

**Conclusion:** POWSM模型不仅能够匹敌或超越现有的音素识别模型，而且还能同时支持拼写-语音转换、语音-拼写转换和自动语音识别等任务。这表明，POWSM框架能够在跨任务场景下提供卓越的性能，促进了科学开放和低资源条件下语音处理的发展。

**Abstract:** Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial
progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone
recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely
been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and
datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech
Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple
phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text
(graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and
low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR
models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P,
P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open
science.

**Motivation:** 旨在将大型语言模型反向工程分解成人类可理解的计算电路，研究简化模型以揭示特定推理任务所需的最小机制。

**Method:** 研究通过从零开始训练小型、仅含注意力机制的变压器模型来解决符号化间接对象识别（IOI）任务，以探索核心ference-like推理。模型中不包含MLP和归一化层。

**Result:** 一个单层、仅有两个注意力头的模型达到了完美的IOI准确率。研究还表明，通过跨层的查询-值交互，一个两层、单个注意头的模型也能达到类似的表现。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明任务特定的训练诱导产生了高度可解释的最小电路，为探讨变压器推理的计算基础提供了一个控制实验田。

**Abstract:** Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

**Motivation:** 研究的动机在于探讨语音语言模型在整合语音和文本模态方面的能力，特别是在情感不一致语音样本条件下的表现，以验证模型在语音理解和文本语义之间的平衡情况。

**Method:** 采用情感不一致的合成语音数据集对四种语音语言模型进行情感识别任务的评估，旨在测试它们在处理语音情感与语音文本语义不一致的情况下的表现。

**Result:** 该研究通过使用情感不一致的语音样本数据集对四种语音语言模型进行情感识别任务的评估，发现模型主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感来进行任务，这意味着文本相关的表示在很大程度上占据了主导地位，而非语音表示。此外，研究人员还向社区发布了代码和情感不一致合成语音数据集(EMIS)。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，当前的语音语言模型在情感识别上主要依赖于文本语义信息，这表明文本相关的表示占据了主导地位，而语音表示的重要性相对较低。进一步强调了语音语言模型在语音和文本整合方面的局限性。

**Abstract:** Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究动机是探索大规模语言模型（LLMs）识别生物医学文献中研究知识差距的能力，特别是隐式知识差距的识别，这是以前工作较少涉及的领域。

**Method:** 该研究通过两种实验在近1500个文档上进行了测试，涵盖了四个数据集，包括一篇手动标注的生物医学文章。评估了闭权重模型（OpenAI）和开权重模型（Llama和Gemma 2）在段落层面和全文层面的任务表现。为了推理隐式知识差距，引入了基于Toulmin-Abductive 推理方案的TABI。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，无论是闭权重还是开权重的大型语言模型，在识别显式和隐式知识差距方面都表现出强大的能力，且在模型规模更大时性能往往更好。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，LLMs有能力系统性地识别知识候选差距，能为研究的早期阶段、政策制定者和资金决策提供支持。研究还讨论了部署LLMs时可能遇到的失败模式和未来方向，包括领域适应、人机协同验证及公开和闭源模型间的基准测试。

**Abstract:** Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 估算阅读理解项目的认知复杂性对于在向学习者施测之前评估项目难度至关重要。认知特征，如答案推理过程中产生的特征，并不能轻易地通过现有的NLP工具提取出来，而是在传统上依赖于人工标注。

**Method:** 本研究主要探讨了大型语言模型(LLMs)是否可以通过关注证据范围和转换级别这两个维度来估算阅读理解项目中的认知复杂性。这两个维度反映了在推理答案过程中所涉及的认知负担程度。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，LLMs能近似估算出阅读理解项目的认知复杂性，表明它们有潜力作为预先难度分析的工具。进一步分析发现，在正确作答的情况下，LLMs有时也未能准确识别出其自身推理过程中的特征。

**Conclusion:** 虽然LLMs展示了估算阅读理解项目认知复杂性的潜力，但研究也揭示了其推理能力和元认知意识之间的差距。

**Abstract:** Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的计算语言学处理情感的方法将其视为单一维度的标尺，而忽略了语言的多维结构。该工作旨在通过引入一个新的框架来解决这一问题，更好地解释多维叙述极性场。

**Method:** 本研究提出了TOPol框架，使用基于变压器的大型语言模型(embedding)、邻点调整UMAP投影以及Leiden分割方法进行话题分割。通过计算给定上下文边界(A和B话语体系之间)对应话题边界中心之间的方向向量，得到一个能够量化话语体系转换过程中细微语义位移的极性场。

**Result:** 实验结果在两个语料库上进行验证：(i) 美联储演讲，捕捉宏观经济转折点的无情感语义变化；(ii) 亚马逊产品评论，捕捉情感极性的变化。结果证明，TOPol能够一致地捕捉情感和非情感极性转换。

**Conclusion:** TOPol框架提供了一种可扩展、通用和解释性强的方法，适用于上下文敏感的多维话语分析。实验验证了其在捕捉不同情感和语义变化方面的有效性。

**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

**Conclusion:** 

**Abstract:** Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

> 研究引入DEBATE，一个评估多代理角色扮演LLM互动真实性的大规模实证基准，捕捉真实人类对话的特征，并通过DEBATE评估和微调LLM，显示了其在表面指标上的改进和语义对齐上的局限性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 准确地模拟通过社会互动的意见变化对于解决诸如错误信息和极化等问题至关重要。现有的单代理对齐并不能保证真实多代理群体动态，当前的LLM角色扮演设置往往产生不自然的动态（如过早收敛），缺乏一个.empirical.基准来衡量真实的人类意见轨迹。

**Method:** 本研究通过引入DEBATE，这是一个大规模的实证基准，专门用于评估多代理角色扮演大语言模型（LLMs）之间的互动真实性。DEBATE包含来自2,792名美国参与者在107个争议话题上进行多轮辩论对话的29,417条消息，捕捉了公众表达的信息和私人报告的意见。

**Result:** 使用DEBATE，研究系统地评估了模拟和真实群体动力学之间的关键差异，并展示了DEBATE在通过监督微调对齐LLMs与人类行为方面的效用。虽然提高了表面级指标（如ROUGE-L和消息长度），但在更深层次的语义对齐上仍存在局限性。

**Conclusion:** 研究发现，角色扮演的LLM代理在现实地模拟人类社会动态方面既具有潜力，也存在当前的局限性。

**Abstract:** Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Main category: cs.CL

> The research investigates the effectiveness of pretraining strategies for machine translation in low-resource languages, using Lingala as an example, and finds that multilingual and mixed-data pretraining methods improve translation quality, promoting inclusive NLP model developments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this research is to improve the machine translation performance for low-resource languages and to provide effective pretraining strategies that could help bridge the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages, thereby contributing to more inclusive NLP models.

**Method:** This study explores different pretraining methodologies involving multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data for developing a machine translation model tailored for Lingala, a low-resource African language. The research builds upon the pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021) that was originally intended for high-resource languages.

**Result:** The findings of the study demonstrate that pretraining on multiple languages and the integration of both monolingual and parallel data effectively enhance the translation quality of low-resource languages, specifically Lingala in this case.

**Conclusion:** The research concludes that effective pretraining methodologies can greatly enhance translation performance in low-resource settings. It encourages further development of more inclusive and accurate NLP models for marginalized communities, emphasizing the importance of reproducibility by making the code and datasets public, with some limited data exceptions due to public availability changes.

**Abstract:** This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public
availability.

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步改变了自然语言处理，但其在大规模语料库上的训练也带来了诸如敏感个人信息和版权材料的泄露等显著风险。机器反向学习作为一项关键技术，能够针对性地清除LLMs中的特定知识，而不影响其整体性能，从而符合法律和伦理标准，如“被遗忘权”。

**Method:** 本篇论文通过系统性地回顾自2021年以来关于大型语言模型(machine unlearning)的超过180篇论文，专注于大规模生成模型的训练。不同于之前的文献综述，本文引入了机器反向学习方法和评估的新分类法，并根据其应用阶段（训练阶段、训练后和推理阶段）对方法进行清晰分类。

**Result:** 本文提出了对机器反向学习方法和评估的新分类法，并在现有数据集和度量指标的基础上提供了详细的优缺点分析。

**Conclusion:** 本文详尽的综述旨在为安全可靠的大型语言模型的发展提供信息和指导，重点讨论了主要挑战和未来研究方向。

**Abstract:** The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

**Motivation:** 现有离散音频表示方法在嘈杂或现实环境下表现不佳，本研究旨在通过改进模型来提高其在噪声环境中的鲁棒性与性能。

**Method:** 该模型基于量化Whisper嵌入，通过潜空间中分离清洁语音和背景噪音，生成可解释的噪音向量并通过轻量级分类器监督，从而改进了语音-单元模型。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，该模型可以提高清洁和嘈杂语音与文本的对齐度，并展示了对噪音的高不变性，同时提高了语音识别性能，错误率降低了82%。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，本研究提出的方法不仅可以提高ASR在嘈杂环境下的性能，同时生成的语音令牌空间能够广泛适应已经见过和未见过的声学条件。

**Abstract:** Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统检索方法将非结构化文档直接作为原始文本处理，给LLM带来了碎片化信息整合和上下文推理的负担，催生了新的检索范式的需求。

**Method:** MDP框架被提出，该框架定义了多条途径将非结构化文档转化为LLM可用的结构化知识表征，包括能动性推理、记忆锚定和结构化利用。

**Result:** 实验结果显示MDP-Agent在信息检索基准测试中优于基线模型，证明了MDP框架的合理性和其能动性实例的有效性。

**Conclusion:** MDP框架和其具体实现MDP-Agent在处理非结构化文档转化为LLM可用知识方面展示了显著效果，证明了新型检索范式的潜力。

**Abstract:** AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

> 这项研究通过创建包含英语、斯瓦希里语和豪萨语10,000个问题的基准测试，分析了顶尖语言模型在资源较少语言中的表现。结果表明，这些模型在资源丰富的语言中表现出色，但在低资源语言中准确度下降。链式思维提升了一些较弱模型的表现，但对于能力强的模型可能产生负面影响。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究旨在探讨大型语言模型在低资源语言环境中的表现是否依旧优秀，以此检验它们强大的性能是由于真正的能力还是单纯的数据优势。

**Method:** 研究通过创建一个包含英语（高资源语言）、斯瓦希里语（中资源语言）和豪萨语（低资源语言）各10,000个问题的大规模基准测试，评估GPT-4 Turbo、Gemini 1.5 Flash 和LLaMA 3 70B等顶级模型在资源较少语言的表现。此外，还测试了链式思维（Chain-of-Thought）提示法对模型表现的影响。

**Result:** 研究结果表明：所有模型在英语基准测试中表现优秀，但在斯瓦希里语中准确度下降，在豪萨语中下降尤为明显，尤其是LLaMA 3的表现最差。对于表现不佳的LLaMA 3，链式思维有助于提升其准确度；然而，对于能力强的GPT-4和Gemini，链式思维反而常导致‘过度思考’，影响其跨语言性能。

**Conclusion:** 研究揭示了链式思维不是万能的解决方案，其有效性依赖于模型的基线能力和特定的任务背景。此外，研究框架也揭示了大型语言模型在跨语言任务中的弱点。

**Abstract:** While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大语言模型在代理框架中为个人用户辅助日益增加的应用，但对于能够主动管理复杂、多方协作的代理的需求也随之增长。现存的系统评估方法稀缺，限制了能够有效支持多人合作的AI进展。

**Method:** 本文提出了ProMediate框架，用于评估主动AI调解代理在复杂多主题、多方谈判中的性能。该框架由两个核心组件构成：基于现实谈判案例和理论驱动难度等级（ProMediate-Easy、ProMediate-Medium和ProMediate-Hard）的模拟测试床，以及一套新的评估指标，用于测量协调变化、干预延迟、中介者效率和智能。

**Result:** 结果显示出，一个社交智能的中介代理比通用基线表现得更好，它具有更快、更精确的干预能力。在ProMediate-Hard情景下，社交中介者比通用基线增加协调变化3.6个百分点（10.65% vs 7.01%），响应速度提高了77%（15.98秒 vs 3.71秒）。

**Conclusion:** 结论认为，ProMediate提供了一个严格、理论基础的测试床，以推动主动、社交智能代理人的开发进程。

**Abstract:** While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

**Conclusion:** 为低资源、特定领域的问题回答提供了一条有效的可扩展解决方案。

**Abstract:** Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 多模态讽刺检测在资源匮乏的情况下尤为困难，在这种情况下，由于标注数据稀少，难以学习到微妙的图文矛盾，这会妨碍模型的性能。现有的参数高效微调（PEFT）方法可以减少过拟合，但因受到少量样本数据的监督限制，未能达到最优表现。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种名为PEKD的统一框架，通过从在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型（作为教师模型）中进行知识蒸馏来增强参数高效的微调方法（如适配器、LoRA、提示调优）。为了减轻来自教师模型的不可靠信号，我们引入了基于教师模型信心水平的熵感知门控机制，动态调整蒸馏强度。

**Result:** 实验表明，在两个公开数据集上，我们的PEKD框架使PEFT方法的表现超越了之前的方法及大型多模态模型，特别是在少量样本的情况下表现强于其他方法。

**Conclusion:** 该框架具有模块化和可适应性，适用于广泛种类的多模态模型及任务。

**Abstract:** Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Current research on LLMs for solving mathematical problems tends to enhance only one paradigm. We aim to enhance both N-CoT and P-CoT paradigms simultaneously to fully exploit their strengths.

**Method:** We propose Parrot, a training pipeline that includes three subtasks for integrating P-CoT and N-CoT, a hybrid training strategy for enhancing natural language semantic transferability, and an auxiliary reward for addressing sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization.

**Result:** Experiments show that Parrot significantly improves both N-CoT and P-CoT performance, particularly for N-CoT, with LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA N-CoT performance increasing by +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the resource-intensive RL baseline.

**Conclusion:** Parrot, an innovative training pipeline, effectively improves the performance of both N-CoT and P-CoT, particularly boosting N-CoT performance with a remarkable gain over resource-intensive methods.

**Abstract:** Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

**Motivation:** The motivation is to enhance business agents in complex settings with intricate data relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, leveraging the rapid development of LLM-based agents.

**Method:** To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business environments, a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm are employed during training. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is introduced.

**Result:** The model achieves competitive results in both B2B and B2C business scenarios on the CRMArena-Pro dataset, underscoring its practical value for real-world applications.

**Conclusion:** The approach demonstrates practical value in CRM business scenarios, with a lightweight model achieving competitive results.

**Abstract:** Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

**Motivation:** 鉴于最近有关将大型语言模型纳入法律从业人员工具箱的学术建议，该论文旨在实证论证当前法律学者和联邦法官实践中LLM解释的潜在风险。

**Method:** 通过实证研究分析大型语言模型(LLMs)在法律解释中的应用及效果。

**Result:** 研究发现，LLMs提供的法律解释判断不稳定，不同的问题格式可能导致完全不同的结论，并且LLMs与人类判断的相关性较弱至中等，模型和问题变体之间的差异很大。

**Conclusion:** 由于LLMs提供的结论存在显著的不稳定性和较大的变异度，这表明过度依赖生成式AI的法律解释是有风险的。

**Abstract:** Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

**Method:** The paper compares conversational and question-answering instruction tuning datasets, using decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters, in both fine-tuning and zero-shot evaluation settings.

**Result:** Instruction tuning yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios. Sequential curricula outperform merged data. However, improvements are not consistently seen in zero-shot tasks.

**Conclusion:** There is a trade-off between adaptation focused on interaction and broad linguistic generalization when tuning small-scale LMs.

**Abstract:** This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

> A new data-driven pipeline leveraging Large Language Models was developed to identify patterns of technological convergence, allowing for the monitoring and forecasting of transformative technologies in fast-evolving fields like ICTs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The aim is to develop a data-driven method to monitor and forecast transformative technologies, addressing the limitations of traditional expert-based methods in keeping up with fast innovation cycles and evolving terminology.

**Method:** Our approach uses Large Language Models to extract semantic triples from text, constructs a technology-related graph, and employs graph-based metrics to detect signs of technological convergence. It includes stages like multi-stage filtering, clustering of domain-specific keywords, and temporal trend analysis of topic co-occurrences.

**Result:** The pipeline was tested on datasets of arXiv preprints and USPTO patent applications, demonstrating its efficacy in detecting convergence signals across various technological domains.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the proposed data-driven pipeline is capable of identifying both established and emerging convergence patterns, providing a scalable way to forecast technologies based on full-text analysis.

**Abstract:** Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究揭示大型语言模型生成参考文献的能力受基础记忆影响，指出高度引用的论文具有更低的幻化率，几乎被模型完全记住。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究假设大型语言模型正确生成参考文献信息的能力取决于其生成或记忆的基础知识，重点关注高引用次数的论文（即在训练语料库中出现频率更高）的幻化率较低。

**Method:** 使用GPT-4.1生成并手动验证了跨二十个计算机科学领域的100条参考文献记录，通过生成和真实元数据之间的余弦相似性来衡量事实一致性。

**Result:** 结果表明（i）幻化率在研究领域间有所不同，（ii）引用次数与事实准确性高度相关，以及（iii）超过约1,000次引用后，参考文献信息几乎完全被记忆。

**Conclusion:** 发现高度引用的论文几乎被模型完全记住了，意味着一个从泛化转向记忆的阈值存在。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

> The paper presents SQPsych, a synthetic dialogue generation framework for mental health therapy using psychological profiles and open-weight LLMs, addressing data privacy and scarcity issues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation for this method is the lack of authentic therapy dialogues for training AI models due to strict privacy regulations and limited recording of clinical sessions, leading to a gap in the development of AI for mental health applications.

**Method:** The method presented is the SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy) framework, which generates synthetic therapy dialogues grounded in CBT principles using structured psychological inputs and open-weight LLMs to simulate therapist-client interactions.

**Result:** The results show that the SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on SQPsychConv surpass baseline models in key therapeutic skills on counseling benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of synthetic data in training AI for mental health support.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that synthetic data can enable the development of scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for mental health applications, overcoming existing limitations due to data governance and privacy restrictions.

**Abstract:** The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic
therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical
sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline
that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client
profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic
conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our
framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts
structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through
therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to
third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are
infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a
high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert
evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on
SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing
baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of
synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for
mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前设计用于文本完成的大型语言模型（LLM）服务系统由于其刚性的设计，既不高效也不适用于日益复杂的LLM应用。我们提出一种新的架构以解决这一问题。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种新的LLM服务系统架构，通过服务程序（称为LLM推理程序LIPs）而非提示来解决现有系统的问题。LIPs允许用户在运行时自定义标记预测和KV缓存管理，并允许用户卸载部分应用程序逻辑到服务器，例如工具执行。

**Result:** 我们通过一个名为Symphony的系统来展示了这种架构的示例，它作为LIPs的操作系统。Symphony通过系统调用暴露LLM模型计算，并具有专用文件系统虚拟化的KV缓存，同时用两级进程调度方案保证GPU效率。

**Conclusion:** Symphony有潜力为LLM应用程序开启一个更高效和可扩展的生态系统。

**Abstract:** Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

**Motivation:** 动机在于解决现有手语翻译数据集规模小、缺乏多语言覆盖以及手工注释依赖导致的成本高昂问题，通过自动框架减少人工注释工作量。

**Method:** 内容提出了一种利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）的自动注释和过滤框架，用于跨8种手语和YouTube-SL-25数据集的手语视频处理，包括脸部可见性检测、手势活动识别、从视频内容中提取文本以及验证视频与文本之间的一致性等步骤。

**Result:** 创建了TikTok-SL-8大规模手语视频数据集，并评估了两个现成的手语翻译模型在过滤后的数据集上的性能，旨在建立基准并评估近期模型在自动抽取数据上的鲁棒性。

**Conclusion:** 该工作促进了手语翻译领域的大规模、弱监督预训练以及从社交媒体中获取数据的能力。

**Abstract:** Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

> Examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret implicature for more natural human-AI interaction, finding that understanding context improves response quality, especially for smaller models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The study aims to explore how the linguistic concept of implicature can be utilized to improve human-AI interaction by refining the ability of LLMs to understand user intent and generate more natural, contextually relevant responses.

**Method:** This study examines LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and the impact of understanding implicature on response generation.

**Result:** Larger models approximate human interpretations of implicature more accurately compared to smaller models. Implicature-based prompts improve the relevance and quality of responses, significantly benefiting smaller models. 67.6% of participants preferred contextually nuanced responses with embedded implicature over literal interpretations.

**Conclusion:** The research highlights the importance of linguistic theory, especially implicature, for enhancing the perceived quality and relevance of responses from LLMs, aiding in the alignment problem by making HAI interaction more natural.

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

**Result:** 对涵盖来自6个Lean项目的613个定理的6个现有最先进模型的评估结果显示，这些模型在现实环境中表现不佳，最佳模型的通过率仅为10.3%。

**Conclusion:** RLMEval提供了一个新的、具有挑战性的基准，旨在指导和加速形式化数学的自动推理进展。

**Abstract:** Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

**Conclusion:** DrivingScene 方法在动态场景重建和新视角合成方面表现出了优越性。

**Abstract:** Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view

**Conclusion:** M-ACM 通过利用从人体网格恢复中获取的运动表示，成功地提升了视频文本描述的语义精准度和空间对齐性。

**Abstract:** Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex

**Motivation:** 由于缺乏真实标记量测数据，研究旨在通过合成数据来训练深度学习模型以实现SAR图像的自动目标识别，并评估与解决仿真环境生成数据不完全代表真实世界的挑战。

**Method:** 本研究采用两种不同的合成孔径雷达（SAR）仿真器：基于散射中心模型的MOCEM和基于光线追踪策略的Salsa，生成合成数据集以解决自动目标识别（ATR）模型在真实数据上泛化能力差的问题。同时，使用名为ADASCA的深度学习方法来训练ATR模型。

**Result:** 研究结果显示，通过两种不同仿真器生成的数据训练的ATR模型在MSTAR数据集上达到了近88%的准确率。

**Conclusion:** 使用两种不同仿真方法生成的合成数据集结合深度学习方法ADASCA，可以有效提升SAR图像中的自动目标识别任务的准确性。

**Abstract:** This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统反向不确定性建模严重依赖于高精度参考数据，这些数据通常在大规模应用中难以获取或成本极高。为了应对这一问题，本研究提出了一种新的不确定性评估方法。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种基于机器学习的点级不确定性评估框架，该框架利用局部几何特征与点级误差之间的关系进行学习。框架采用两种集合学习模型（随机森林RF和XGBoost）进行实现，这些模型在一个空间分区的实际数据集上训练和验证，以避免数据泄露。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，这两种模型能够有效捕捉几何特征与不确定性之间的非线性关系，平均ROC-AUC值超过0.87。研究进一步揭示，描述高程变化、点密度和局部结构复杂性的几何特征在预测不确定性方面起着决定性作用。

**Conclusion:** 提出的框架提供了一种数据驱动的不确定性评估视角，为未来大规模点云的质量控制和误差分析奠定了可扩展和适应性强的基础。

**Abstract:** Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

**Motivation:** 目前很少有研究探索同步结合眼球追踪和面部特征进行阿尔茨海默病的诊断，而这些特征可以作为重要的认知功能指标

**Method:** 提出了一种多模态交叉增强融合框架，包括交叉增强融合注意力模块和方向感知卷积模块。

**Result:** 在自建的25位阿尔茨海默病患者和25位健康对照组的同步多模态数据集上验证了该框架的有效性，取得了95.11%的分类准确率。

**Conclusion:** 该框架通过显式建模跨模态依赖和模态特异性贡献，比传统晚期融合和特征拼接方法具有更好的鲁棒性和诊断表现。

**Abstract:** Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to enable real-time inference for high-fidelity, photorealistic human face renderings in resource-constrained VR devices, to facilitate more immersive and portable VR experiences without significant latency or power consumption.

**Method:** Proposes an efficient post-training quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models and designs a custom hardware accelerator for integration into the system-on-chip of VR devices to optimize processing efficiency.

**Result:** ESCA framework boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to +0.39, reduces latency by up to 3.36 times, and achieves a rendering rate of 100 frames per second, all while maintaining high-quality output.

**Conclusion:** The proposed ESCA framework significantly enhances the performance of photorealistic Codec Avatars on resource-limited VR devices, enabling high-fidelity rendering and real-time interaction within VR environments.

**Abstract:** Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind the paper is to address the inefficiency of traditional and existing techniques in dealing with multi-view data due to the lack of clear graph structures and the complexity of multi-view data scenarios.

**Method:** The paper proposes RSGSLM, which integrates linear feature transformation, multi-view graph fusion, dynamic pseudo-label incorporation, and an unsupervised smoothing loss within a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) framework to address the challenges of graph structure integration in multi-view data.

**Result:** Experimental results on multi-view benchmark image datasets indicate that the proposed RSGSLM outperforms existing semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that the novel approach of combining linear feature transformation, multi-view graph fusion, dynamic pseudo-label incorporation, and unsupervised smoothing loss within a GCN framework can effectively address the challenges associated with graph structure integration in multi-view data, providing enhanced performance and computational efficiency.

**Abstract:** Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前的视觉语言模型虽然在多模态推理方面取得了显著进展，但现有的基准数据集在高质量和人验证的样例上存在不足，并且多语言支持有限。这促使引入PISA-Bench，旨在解决这些局限。

**Method:** 分析方法包括从专家设计的PISA测试中提取英文示例以创建跨六种语言的并行语料库，并评估现有视觉语言模型在该基准上的表现。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，在PISA-Bench上，尤其是参数少于20B的小型视觉语言模型得分低，非英语语言和空间几何推理上的性能下降显著。

**Conclusion:** 通过发布数据集和评估框架，研究为推进多语言多模态推理研究提供了有价值的资源。

**Abstract:** Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient

systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational

delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We

**Motivation:** 理解视觉语言模型中冲突适应现象的内在机制以及这些模型如何模拟人类的认知控制资源的招募过程。

**Method:** 使用了顺序Stroop任务测试了13个视觉语言模型（VLMs），并利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在InternVL 3.5 4B模型中识别任务相关的超节点。

**Result:** 12个视觉语言模型表现出与冲突适应一致的行为，大部分模型在早期和晚期层中出现了部分重叠的文本和颜色的超节点，而在第24-25层中，发现了一个受冲突调节的超节点，该节点的消除显著增加了斯托普错误但对一致性的试验证据影响很小。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明视觉语言模型的行为类似于人类的认知控制机制，特别是在冲突适应方面，进一步揭示了模型内部认知控制的表征基础。

**Abstract:** A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

> $DualCap$ enhances visual representation in image caption models by integrating features from visually similar images, improving performance with fewer parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the semantic gap created by using retrieved data only as text prompts without enhancing the original visual features, especially for object details and complex scenes.

**Method:** Recent lightweight models use retrieved data only as text prompts, creating a semantic gap. $DualCap$ introduces a dual retrieval mechanism, using image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and image-to-image retrieval for visual prompts. It captures key objects and details from visually similar scenes, encodes textual features, and integrates them with original image features through a lightweight feature fusion network.

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that $DualCap$ achieves competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters compared to previous approaches.

**Conclusion:** $DualCap$ effectively bridges the semantic gap in lightweight retrieval-augmented image captioning models by enriching their visual representation through a dual retrieval mechanism, leading to improved performance.

**Abstract:** Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 鱼鲜度的评估对确保食品安全和减少海产行业的经济损失至关重要。然而，传统的感官评价存在主观性、耗时和不一致性的问题。尽管深度学习的进展已经在视觉新鲜度预测方面实现了自动化，但在准确性和特征透明度方面仍存有挑战。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种统一的三阶段框架来改进和利用深度视觉表征进行可靠的鱼鲜度评估。首先，对ResNet-50、DenseNet-121、EfficientNet-B0、ConvNeXt-Base和Swin-Tiny这五种最先进的视觉架构进行微调以建立一个强有力的基础。其次，从这些骨架中提取多级深度特征，用于训练七个传统的机器学习分类器，融合了深度和传统决策机制。最后，利用Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM)、Random Forest和Lasso进行特征选择，找出一个紧凑且具信息量的特征子集。

**Result:** 在鱼类眼睛鲜度(Freshness of the Fish Eyes, FFE)数据集上的实验表明，最佳配置即结合Swin-Tiny特征、Extra Trees分类器和基于LGBM的特征选择的方法，达到了85.99%的准确率，比在相同数据集上发表的近期研究提高了8.69-22.78%。

**Conclusion:** 本框架的发现验证了其在视觉质量评估任务中的有效性和通用性。

**Abstract:** Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

**Conclusion:** 本研究表明MVFNDB基准测试为未来的多模态大语言模型评估和视频假新闻检测任务的发展提供了坚实的基础。

**Abstract:** The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

**Motivation:** 随着文本到图像模型的快速发展，确保其安全性变得至关重要。现有安全方法由于成本效益高而广受采纳，但这些方法常常存在过度拒绝和安全性与实用性不平衡的问题。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了这种新框架。

**Method:** 我们在论文中提出了一种多轮安全编辑框架，其中的核心是一个多重轮次的图像-文本交替数据集，名为MR-SafeEdit。该框架下，我们开发了一个名为SafeEditor的统一多轮次语言模型，能够对生成的图像进行多轮次的安全编辑。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果显示，SafeEditor不仅减少了过度拒绝问题，还达到了更好的安全性和实用性之间的平衡，这比以前的安全方法更加优越。

**Abstract:** With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

**Abstract:** Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs

**Motivation:** 尽管流匹配在生成任务上取得了显著的成功，但影响其生成质量的因素仍然不太清楚。为了深入理解这个问题，作者通过探讨流匹配模型和去噪器之间的关系，来探索生成过程的本质。

**Method:** 通过采用去噪的视角并设计一个框架来实验性地探测生成过程，本文建立了流匹配模型和去噪器之间的形式化联系，并为它们在生成和去噪上的性能对比提供了共同的基础。

**Result:** 本文设计了以噪声和漂移为中心的原则性且受控的扰动来影响样本生成，这些扰动揭示了生成过程中的不同动力学阶段。

**Conclusion:** 这一研究为理解流匹配模型生成过程的不同阶段提供了精确的描述，阐明了在生成过程中的哪些阶段去噪器能够成功或失败以及其重要性。

**Abstract:** Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前的深度学习方法主要将成熟度视为离散分类问题，而这种方法与生物成熟过程的连续性不符，导致信息丢失和类别边界模糊。因此，本研究将其重新定义为连续的概率学习任务。

**Method:** 通过引入专门的概率头对最先进的实时目标检测器RT-DETRv2进行改进，使模型能够对每个检测到的对象预测成熟的连续分布，同时学习平均成熟状态及其相关的不确定性。

**Result:** 通过大量的实验，相比基于分类的方法，该概率方法提供了更加精细和准确的成熟度评估，为现代农业中的智能、具有不确定性意识的自动化系统铺平了道路。

**Conclusion:** 本研究提出的模型不仅提供了更丰富和生物学上更合理的植物成熟度表示，而且保持了卓越的检测性能，在一个具有挑战性的大型水果数据集上达到了85.6%的平均精度。

**Abstract:** Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

**Motivation:** 尽管Alves等人基于骨架的方法在识别性能上有显著提高，但使用OpenPose进行关键点提取会降低时间性能。因此，本文旨在探索借助轻量级关键点检测方法提高处理速度和识别准确性的可能性。

**Method:** 本文探讨了在巴西手语（LIBRAS）中使用轻量级身体关键点检测进行孤立手势识别的可行性。论文研究了通过使用轻量级的MediaPipe替代OpenPose以提高处理速度的问题，并实验了关键点子集选择策略以优化识别性能。此外，还展示了基于样条插值的方法可以有效缓解关键点缺失问题，提高识别准确率。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，适当的关键点子集可以达到或优于现有先进方法的性能，并且将处理时间减少了超过5倍。同时，基于样条插值的方法大幅提高了识别准确率。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，通过精心选择关键点并结合简单的插补技术，可以实现高效的孤立手势识别，为手语识别系统的规模化应用铺平道路。

**Abstract:** This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

**Result:** The proposed methodology is computationally efficient and requires minimal infrastructure modifications for real-world application.

**Conclusion:** The vehicle detection component is an effective solution for urban traffic optimization.

**Abstract:** Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

**Motivation:** 尽管现有文本到视频的生成模型在遵循外部相机控制方面表现较好，但它们在处理非传统相机运动时仍然存在困难，这影响了创造真正原创和艺术视频的能力。为此，提出VividCam这一模型。

**Method:** VividCam采用了一种训练范式，允许扩散模型从合成视频中学习复杂的相机运动，从而摆脱对收集真实训练视频的依赖。它结合了多种解缠策略，将摄像机运动学习与合成外观伪影隔离，确保了更为稳健的运动表示，并减轻了领域变化的影响。

**Conclusion:** VividCam通过创新的训练范式和解缠策略，提高了生成模型对复杂相机运动的学习能力，这对于创建真正原创的艺术视频至关重要。

**Abstract:** Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data

light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 在多模态学习中，主导模态往往会盖过其他模态，从而限制了模型的泛化能力。M-SAM 是一个模型无关的框架，能够应用于多种模态且支持早期和后期融合场景，旨在解决这个问题。

**Method:** 在每轮迭代中，Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM) 框架通过三个步骤进行优化。首先，根据Shapley值确定主导模态。其次，调节损失函数，以优化模型对主导模态的鲁棒性。最后，通过调整后的梯度进行反向传播以更新权重。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，M-SAM 在四个多样化的数据集上展现了优势，相对于最新优化和梯度操纵方法，显著提高了多模态学习的表现。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果证明了M-SAM在多模态场景下的有效性，显示了其在优化模型对主导模态鲁棒性的同时，也提升了其他模态的贡献，从而提升了整体学习性能。

**Abstract:** In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

**Conclusion:** IBIS方法能够在Wi-Fi传感中有效地克服模型过度拟合问题，实现高准确率的动作识别。

**Abstract:** The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

**Abstract:** Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

**Motivation:** The motivation of the paper is to develop a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system (ALPR) that can overcome challenges posed by environmental factors and image quality issues. The system is intended for applications such as traffic control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement.

**Method:** This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for license plate detection and recognition, employing a semi-supervised learning framework. Grounding DINO is utilized for automatic annotation of license plate images, generating pseudo-labels that supplement a small amount of manually labeled data to enhance training efficiency and model performance.

**Result:** The proposed method achieved a recall rate of 94% on the CENPARMI dataset and 91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. Additionally, it provides character error rates for both datasets to assess system performance.

**Conclusion:** The deep learning method using YOLOv8 and semi-supervised learning with Grounding DINO for pseudo-labeling demonstrates significant improvements in license plate detection and recognition accuracy. It reduces the dependency on manual labeling and enhances model performance.

**Abstract:** Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

**Abstract:** Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this paper is to address the efficiency concern of large-scale pretraining in vision-language models by reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.

**Method:** Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP) is used to dynamically merge tokens in the deeper layers of a visual encoder, adapting to the input images.

**Result:** The method shows a significant reduction in GFLOPS while maintaining comparable performance in image classification and zero-shot tasks, as well as validated in biological data for scientific domains.

**Conclusion:** The proposed method, DRIP, effectively reduces the computational cost of pretraining vision-language models without sacrificing performance, making it a promising approach for more efficient large-scale pretraining.

**Abstract:** Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

**Abstract:** Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models

visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

> 本文提出的VDRP框架通过视觉多样性感知的方法和区域认知来改进零样本人体物件互动检测，能够在处理视觉复杂度时获得更好的效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 文章旨在解决现有方法在处理人体和物体互动检测时存在的视觉多样性（同一动词在不同姿势和上下文中出现的多样性）和视觉嵌套（不同动词产生视觉上相似的模式）的问题，希望提供一个更高效的方法来应对这些挑战。

**Method:** 文章提出了一种名为VDRP的框架，用于处理人体和物体互动检测中的视觉多样性和区域感知提示学习问题。该方法首先引入了一种视觉多样性感知的提示学习策略，将组内视觉差异嵌入到上下文嵌入中，并通过高斯扰动来鼓励提示捕捉动词的多样性视觉变化；其次，通过从人类、物体和联合区域检索区域特定的概念来增强多样性的提示嵌入，从而产生区域感知的提示，提高动词级别的区分度。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，在HICO-DET基准测试下，该方法在四种零样本评估环境下均达到了最先进的性能，有效地解决了组内视觉多样性和组间视觉嵌套的问题。

**Conclusion:** 提出的VDRP框架通过一种视觉多样化感知和区域感知的方法，有效提高了零样本人体-物体互动检测的性能。该方法在多种评估条件下实现了最先进的表现，证明了其有效性和优越性。

**Abstract:** Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的几何先验无法保证室内和城市环境中低纹理区域的全局一致性。高斯点云法和隐式SDF场常常存在不连续性或计算效率低下，导致细节丢失。因此，我们需要提出一种新的方法来解决这些问题。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种Atlanta-world引导的隐式结构化高斯点云法，以改善室内和城市环境中低纹理区域的三维重建问题。通过使用Atlanta-world模型，我们能够确保低纹理区域的精确表面重建。此外，我们还提出了一种语义GS表示方法来预测所有语义区域的概率，并部署了带有可训练平面指标的结构平面规则化方法以实现全局精确表面重建。

**Conclusion:** 该研究通过Atlanta-world引导的隐式结构化高斯点云法，在室内和城市场景的3D重建中取得了更好的结果，尤其是在低纹理区域的精准重建时。这种方法提供了一种既平滑又高效的重建技术。

**Abstract:** 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

> 提出Region-CAM方法改善CAM方法在强调对象区域和对齐对象边界方面的不足，显著增强了弱监督语义分割等任务的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的CAM方法仅突出显示最具辨别力的区域，这往往导致激活图未能覆盖整个对象且与对象边界对齐不佳，从而限制了下游弱监督学习任务的性能。

**Method:** Region-CAM利用从基线分类模型的各个阶段中提取语义信息图（SIMs）并进行语义信息传播（SIP）来生成激活图，这种方法不同于网络特征加权方法。它考虑了每个阶段的梯度和特征。

**Result:** 在PASCAL VOC数据集上，Region-CAM的mIoU分别为60.12%和58.43%，相比传统的CAM方法分别提升了13.61%和13.13%。在MS COCO验证集上，Region-CAM的性能改善了16.23%，达到了36.38%。在ILSVRC2012验证集的物体定位任务中，Region-CAM的Top-1定位准确性为51.7%，比LayerCAM高4.5%。

**Conclusion:** Region-CAM方法通过改进生成激活图的方法，能够较为完整地突出对象区域并提高激活图与对象边界的对齐性，从而增强弱监督学习任务，特别是弱监督语义分割任务的性能。

**Abstract:** Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

**Conclusion:** 总体来说，DINO-YOLO为含有少于10K图像的民用工程数据集建立了最先进的表现，同时保持计算效率，提供了在数据受限环境中用于施工安全监测和基础设施检查的实际解决方案。

**Abstract:** Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited

two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil

providing practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and
infrastructure inspection in data-constrained environments.

**Abstract:** The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

**Result:** Demonstrates effectiveness across a range of tasks including rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation.

**Conclusion:** EA3D offers a unified and efficient approach for joint online 3D reconstruction and scene understanding, supporting a wide array of applications.

**Abstract:** Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and

**Abstract:** Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

**Abstract:** Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

**Motivation:** 当前的城市场景重建方法通常依赖多模态传感器作为输入，这意味着获得准确的LiDAR数据在实践中是具有挑战性的。为了避免获取准确的LiDAR深度的困难，研究者提出了$D^2GS$。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为$D^2GS$的无LiDAR的城市场景重建框架。首先，通过反向投射多视图度量深度预测来初始化密集点云，然后通过渐进式剪枝策略优化点云以提高全局一致性。其次，通过深度增强器联合细化高斯几何和预测的密集度量深度。第三，通过约束道路区域内的高斯形状和法线属性来提高地面几何的准确性。

**Conclusion:** 通过一系列实验，验证了所提方法的有效性，证明了$D^2GS$框架在城市场景重建中的优越性，特别是在几何精度方面超越了使用实际LiDAR数据的方法。

**Abstract:** Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

> 论文提出一种基于全局和局部上下文信息动态调整分类器的方法，改善了语义分割在类别不平衡和个性化图像处理上的效果，实验显示该方法在多个数据集上达到顶尖性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的语义分割方法采用一个普通分类器对每个像素进行分类，这种方法虽然能够从训练数据中学习到全局信息，但这种全局信息是通过固定的权重和偏置来表示的。然而，每张图像的类别分布是不同的，这使得分类器不能处理个别图像的独特特性。数据集层面的类别不平衡也导致了分割结果倾向于多数类别，限制了模型识别和分割少数类区域的能力。

**Method:** 该论文提出了一种扩展上下文感知分类器（ECAC），利用全局（数据集级别）和局部（图像级别）上下文信息动态调整分类器。具体来说，通过内存银行学习各个类别的数据集级别上下文信息，并结合当前图像的类别特定上下文信息以提高分类器对精确像素标签的预测能力。此外，采用了教师-学生网络范式，即领域专家（教师网络）根据真实标签动态调整上下文信息，并向学生网络传递知识。

**Result:** 全面的实验表明，所提出的ECAC在ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10K和Pascal-Context等几个数据集上都能达到最先进的性能。

**Conclusion:** 扩展上下文感知分类器（ECAC）通过结合全局和局部上下文信息，有效提高了语义分割的精确度，特别是在处理类别不平衡和个性化的图像等级上具有显著优势。

**Abstract:** Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

**Motivation:** 现有的测试时自适应对象检测方法过于依赖源数据的统计特性,并且假设源域和目标域共享同一类别空间，本文旨在克服这些限制，设计了不需要源数据的新方法。

**Method:** 本文设计了一种多模态提示均值教师框架，利用视觉和文本提示来调整语言和视觉表示空间，同时提出了测试时预热策略、实例动态记忆（IDM）模块及记忆增强与记忆幻象策略来提高伪标签质量。

**Conclusion:** 研究展示了一种创新的测试阶段自适应检测方法，不再依赖于源数据，能够在新的类别空间中表现出色。

**Abstract:** In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

then channeled into the residual network to extract intricate features at a
deeper level. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of Euclidean distances
against students' face databases is performed, effectively ascertaining the

**Abstract:** Early diagnosis of critical diseases can significantly improve patient
survival and reduce treatment costs. However, existing diagnostic techniques
are often costly, invasive, and inaccessible in low-resource regions. This
paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood
clots, and cardiopulmonary abnormalities. A fine-tuned MobileNetV2
convolutional neural network was trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin
lesion classification, achieving 89.3% accuracy, 91.6% sensitivity, and 88.2%
specificity. A support vector machine (SVM) with handcrafted features was
employed for thermal clot detection, achieving 86.4% accuracy (AUC = 0.89) on
synthetic and clinical data. For cardiopulmonary analysis, lung and heart sound
datasets from PhysioNet and Pascal were processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC) and classified via Random Forest, reaching 87.2% accuracy
and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models
demonstrates that the proposed system achieves competitive results while
remaining lightweight and deployable on low-cost devices. The framework
provides a promising step toward scalable, real-time, and accessible AI-based
pre-diagnostic healthcare solutions.

*Junsheng Zhou,Xingyu Shi,Haichuan Song,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

> U-CAN is an unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising that utilizes a consistency-aware noise matching scheme to improve denoised geometry consistency without requiring noisy-clean pairs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to reduce the manual effort required in training neural networks for point cloud denoising, while also enhancing the quality of the denoised outputs by addressing the negative effects of noise on downstream applications.

**Method:** The method involves a novel loss for statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations and a constraint for ensuring geometry consistency during the denoising process.

**Result:** The results show significant improvement over previous unsupervised methods and comparable performance to supervised methods on widely used benchmarks for point cloud denoising, upsampling, and image denoising.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that U-CAN offers a more efficient and effective approach to point cloud denoising without the need for manual paired data preparation, and the introduced constraint can benefit not only 3D data but also 2D image denoising.

**Abstract:** Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

> 提出了MSF-Net，一种新的框架，通过选择性更新策略和特征融合模块来解决特征提取中遇到的问题，从而提高表面法线的估计精度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 然而，现有的基于学习的方法往往无法准确地捕捉到多个阶段的特征，并且不能有效地促进这些特征之间的交互作用。从而，这些模型倾向于提取冗余的特征，特别是在具有复杂细节（如皱纹和边缘）的区域。

**Method:** 为解决这些问题，我们提出了MSF-Net，这是一个用于多阶段信息提取的新框架，配以选择性更新策略，旨在提取高质量的特征信息，这对于准确的法线构造至关重要。此外，我们还开发了一个特征融合模块以提高不同特征之间的相互作用。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，所提出的MSF-Net在表面法线估计的准确性上显著超过了之前最先进的方法。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果证明了，我们提出的MSF-Net在表面法线估计的准确性上显著优于现有方法。

**Abstract:** Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.
