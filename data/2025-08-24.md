### [1] [Efficient Switchable Safety Control in LLMs via Magic-Token-Guided Co-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14904)
*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种使大型语言模型（LLM）内容安全方法更高效、更灵活、更可调的统一协同训练框架。该框架通过融合多种行为和使用简单指令实现精准控制，并在实验中表现出色。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）中的内容安全方法，如监督微调（SFT）和人类反馈强化学习（RLHF），通常依赖多级训练流程，并且在部署后缺乏精细的可控性。为了解决这些问题，并支持更多样的部署场景。

**Method:** 提出了一种统一的协同训练框架，该框架在单一步骤的监督微调（SFT）中，将积极（合法/亲社会的）、消极（未过滤/风险倾向的）和拒绝（拒绝性的/保守的）多种安全行为整合在一起。通过简单的系统级指令或魔法令牌，可以在推理时动态激活每种行为，从而实现无缝且高效的动态切换。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，该方法在安全对齐质量上达到了SFT+DPO的水平，其中8B模型在安全性能上显著优于DeepSeek-R1（671B），同时还显著减少了训练复杂性和部署成本。

**Conclusion:** 本文提供了一种可扩展、高效和高度可控的LLM内容安全解决方案，通过引入安全对齐余量，证明了方法的安全鲁棒性。

**Abstract:** Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 该研究旨在分享WMT25通用机器翻译共享任务中的初步排名结果，以帮助任务参与者准备他们的系统提交论文。

**Method:** 该摘要并未详细说明具体的方法，主要描述了机器翻译系统评估的方式及初步排名情况。

**Result:** 研究结果显示，初步排名基于自动评估，这可能会偏向于使用如质量估计再排序或最小贝叶斯风险解码等再排序技术的系统，最终排名会基于更为可靠的人员评估。

**Conclusion:** 该报告仅用于分享初步的评估结果，人员评估得出的最终排名将更为可靠。

**Abstract:** We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

### [3] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出一种大语言模型驱动的框架，用于自动构建多语言数学问题数据集，以减少英语中心的实体偏见并提高多语言模型的鲁棒性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 目前多语言数学推理在低资源语言中由于缺乏反映准确本地实体（如人名、组织名、货币）的社会文化任务数据集而落后于英语。现有的多语言基准主要是通过翻译产生，通常保留英语中心的实体。

**Method:** 提出了一种由大语言模型驱动的文化本地化框架，用于自动构建含有本地姓名、组织和货币的数学应用题数据集。

**Result:** 通过广泛的实验表明，该框架可以减少英语实体偏见，并在引入各种语言的本地实体时提高鲁棒性。

**Conclusion:** 该框架有助于揭示在适当的社会文化背景下翻译基准可能掩盖的真实多语言数学能力。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

### [4] [Improving LLMs for Machine Translation Using Synthetic Preference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14951)
*Dario Vajda,Domen Vreš,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文通过使用直接偏好优化(DPO)方法并对Slovene语言的翻译任务进行实例验证，证实了对通用大模型GaMS-9B-Instruct进行调优可以有效提高其机器翻译性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文旨在探索如何使用相对少的数据资源改进通用指令调优的大型语言模型在机器翻译中的性能。

**Method:** 本文通过改进GaMS-9B-Instruct模型的方法来提升其在机器翻译中的性能。具体采用了直接偏好优化(DPO)训练方法，基于从英文维基百科文章翻译中产生的高质量排名实例对。这些实例由GaMS-9B-Instruct和EuroLLM-9B-Instruct两个大模型生成后通过启发式方法及COMET等自动评估指标进行了排分。

**Result:** 研究表明，该方法通过使用少量的易于生成的数据资源改进了大型语言模型在机器翻译方面的性能。特别是针对Slovene语言的数据，该模型的翻译质量评估得到了显著提升。

**Conclusion:** 经验证，本文中通过DPO方法调优后的模型在翻译维基百科文章上的COMET得分分别比参与数据生成的两个基础模型GaMS-9B-Instruct和EuroLLM-9B-Instruct高出了0.04和0.02，并且更少出现语言和格式错误。

**Abstract:** Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

### [5] [Multilingual Datasets for Custom Input Extraction and Explanation Requests Parsing in Conversational XAI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14982)
*Qianli Wang,Tatiana Anikina,Nils Feldhus,Simon Ostermann,Fedor Splitt,Jiaao Li,Yoana Tsoneva,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文针对ConvXAI系统在多语言和自定义输入处理上的局限，提出了MultiCoXQL和Compass数据集以及一种新的解析方法。通过这些新方法，我们改善了LLM在多语言对话解释中的应用。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的基于意图识别的ConvXAI系统虽然在识别用户的意图方面显示出高精度和可靠性，尤其是在英语方面，但在多语言泛化方面存在训练数据短缺的挑战。此外，这些系统对于用户自定义输入的支持仍然有限。我们希望通过MultiCoXQL和Compass数据集的建立，以及新的解析方法，来解决这一问题。

**Method:** 我们提出了MultiCoXQL，这是CoXQL数据集的多语言扩展，涵盖了五种类型不同的语言，包括一种低资源语言。我们提出了一种新的解析方法，旨在提高多语言解析性能，并使用多种解析策略评估了三个LLM模型。此外，我们还创建了Compass，这是一个新的多语言数据集，旨在从ConvXAI系统中提取自定义输入，涵盖了与MultiCoXQL相同的五种语言中的11种意图。我们使用三种不同大小的LLM模型和BERT型模型对Compass进行了单语、跨语和多语评估。

**Result:** 通过引入MultiCoXQL和Compass数据集，以及提出的新解析方法，我们解决了在多语言环境下训练数据短缺的问题，并且改进了对自定义输入的支持。我们还评估了不同规模的LLM模型以及BERT型模型在这些数据集上的表现。

**Conclusion:** 我们的研究不仅扩展了ConvXAI系统的多语言能力，而且为用户提供了一个更好的自定义输入提取方案。通过对MultiCoXQL和Compass数据集的评估，表明我们的方法能有效解决当前ConvXAI系统在多语言泛化方面的限制，同时也提升了对用户自定义输入的支持。

**Abstract:** Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

### [6] [Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044)
*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

> 论文介绍了一种新的算法SSS，通过利用对齐的小型草案模型来提高大语言模型的效率，同时降低了推理成本，证明了其有效性和高效性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 应对测试时对齐效率瓶颈，提高大语言模型的安全性和推理能力，同时减少计算成本。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为奖励偏移推测采样（SSS）的算法，该算法利用一个与人类偏好对齐的小型草案模型来高效地预测未来的令牌，而目标模型则保持不变。

**Result:** 实验显示该算法能够在测试时弱到强的对齐实验中，在显著降低推理成本的同时，获得优越的得分。

**Conclusion:** 该算法验证了其在不实际获得RLHF最优解的情况下，通过修改接受标准和奖励分发策略，利用对齐的草案模型和未对齐的目标模型之间的分布变化来恢复RLHF最优解的有效性。

**Abstract:** Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [7] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

> 我们介绍了LongRecall，这是一种三阶段的评估框架，用于确保自动生成的文本的完全性，可以在医学和法律等关键领域中减少漏项错误。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的回召指标通常依赖于词汇重叠，导致在遇到未证实的实体和释义答案时出现错误。而使用长整体提示的LLM作为法官能够捕捉到更广泛的语义，但是没有结构化的验证仍然容易出现偏差和虚构。因此，我们提出了LongRecall框架来解决这些问题。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种名为LongRecall的三阶段回召评估框架，该框架首先将答案分解为自包含的事实，然后通过词形和语义过滤逐步缩小可能的候选匹配，并通过结构化的蕴涵检查来验证它们的一致性。

**Result:** 我们在三个复杂的长形式QA基准上评估了LongRecall，使用了人工标注和LLM判定，证明了在回召准确性上的显著提升。

**Conclusion:** 这项研究为系统性的回召评估提供了一个基础性的构建模块，可有效减少假阳性和假阴性，同时适应多样的措辞和情境变化。

**Abstract:** LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

### [8] [Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090)
*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

> 该论文提出了将大规模语言模型（LLMs）与组合推理相结合的方法，以解决结构化预测任务中的问题，证明这种方法能在各种提示策略下提高预测的一致性和准确性，同时指出校准和使用结构化预测目标进行微调也能提升困难任务的表现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 动机在于解决大规模语言模型在复杂推理和结构化预测任务上的不足，尤其是由于其自回归特性容易产生幻觉。

**Method:** 通过结合大规模语言模型与组合推理方法进行实验，探索有效的提示策略以估计模型置信值，并将其用于符号推理。

**Result:** 实验证明，无论何种提示策略，添加符号推理均能提高预测的一致性和准确性。此外，通过校准和使用结构化预测目标进行微调，可以在难任务中提升性能。

**Conclusion:** 结论指出，在大规模语言模型的时代，结构化学习依旧有价值，结合组合推理和提示策略可以解决模型的结构一致性和复杂推理问题。

**Abstract:** LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

> 这项研究通过新提出的数据提取流水线，创建了高质量的数学语料库，显著提升了数学和代码处理及相关预训练模型的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的以数学为中心的数据集构造以来自Common Crawl的数据，由于数据提取策略的脆弱，HTML到文本转换的质量损失以及无法可靠保存数学结构，导致数据质量下降。因此，需要一种新的方法来提高数学数据集的质量。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种名为Nemotron-CC-Math的大型高质量数学语料库，该语料库由Common Crawl通过一种新的领域无关的流水线构建，专门设计用于稳健的科学文本提取。此流水线通过使用lynx和目标LLM清理阶段，能够跨各种格式（如MathJax，KaTeX，MathML）恢复数学内容。

**Result:** 研究收集了两个大规模高质量的数学语料库，Nemotron-CC-Math-3+(133B tokens)和Nemotron-CC-Math-4+(52B tokens)。特别是Nemotron-CC-Math-4+不仅超越了所有先前的开放数学数据集，还包含了比FineMath-4+多5.5倍的token。使用这个语料库来预训练Nemotron-T 8B模型，能够在MATH和MBPP+上获得显著的性能提升，同时改善MMLU和MMLU-Stem上的通用领域表现。

**Conclusion:** 本研究提出了第一个能够从噪声网络规模数据中可靠提取科学内容（包括数学）的流水线，显著提高了数学、代码和通用推理的性能，成为最先进的开放式数学预训练语料库。为支持开源工作，本研究公开发布其代码和数据集。

**Abstract:** Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

*Seungmin Han,Haeun Kwon,Ji-jun Park,Taeyang Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

> 鉴于当前的大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在处理复杂的多模态交互时表现不佳，作者提出了一种新的评估基准MMDR-Bench和一个增强现有的LVLM的框架CoLVLM Agent，该框架在基准测试中表现优于先进的商业模型。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的模型在处理复杂的、多轮次的、视觉基础的任务时遇到了挑战，这些任务需要深度推理、持续的情境理解、实体跟踪以及遵循多步骤指令。现有的基准测试往往没有很好地捕捉到真实世界多模态交互的动态性和复杂性。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了MMDR-Bench。

**Method:** 我们提出了CoLVLM Agent（情境LVLM代理），这是一个全面的框架，它通过一个迭代的“记忆-感知-规划-执行”周期来增强现有的LVLM，无需对底层模型进行大量的再训练，以提高推理和指令跟随能力。

**Result:** 我们在MMDR-Bench上的广泛实验表明，CoLVLM Agent持续表现出优越性能，获得了平均人工评估得分4.03，明显优于最先进的商业模型如GPT-4o（3.92）和Gemini 1.5 Pro（3.85）。

**Conclusion:** 该框架显示了在推理深度、指令执行遵从性以及错误抑制方面的显著优势，并且在多轮对话中保持了稳健的性能，验证了其模块化设计和迭代方法对复杂多模态交互的有效性。

**Abstract:** Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [12] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

> The paper proposes SemToken, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency by merging semantically equivalent tokens and allocating heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density. It achieves significant reduction in token count and speedup in long-context language modeling tasks without degrading perplexity and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing tokenization methods like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece rely purely on frequency statistics and ignore semantic structure, leading to inefficiencies in long-context scenarios.

**Method:** SemToken first extracts contextual semantic embeddings with lightweight encoders, performs local semantic clustering to merge equivalent tokens, and then allocates token granularity based on semantic density.

**Result:** On benchmarks like WikiText-103 and LongBench, SemToken reduces token count up to 2.4 times and achieves a 1.9 times speedup without degradation in perplexity and downstream accuracy.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that semantic structure can be an essential new axis to optimize tokenization and computation in large language models.

**Abstract:** Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的过程奖励模型主要训练于STEM等领域，缺乏对金融等领域特定逻辑的适应能力。因此，开发一个专门针对金融领域、且能够细粒度评估推理过程的奖励模型是非常有必要的。

**Method:** 文章介绍了一种名为Fin-PRM的领域特化奖励模型，专门用于评估金融任务中的中间推理步骤。该模型结合了步骤级和轨迹级的奖励监督，以实现与金融逻辑一致的推理过程评估。它在离线和在线奖励学习设置中均有应用。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，在金融推理基准测试上，Fin-PRM在轨迹选择质量上优越于通用的PRM和强大的领域基线。使用Fin-PRM训练的下游模型在监督学习、强化学习和测试性能方面与基线相比，分别提高了12.9%、5.2%和5.1%。

**Conclusion:** 研究强调了对LLM在特定金融逻辑下的对齐，表明了领域特化奖励模型的重要性。这些发现证明了Fin-PRM在提高金融决策过程质量方面的潜力。

**Abstract:** Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our

> SPARK通过在通道级别进行非结构化稀疏化处理KV缓存瓶颈问题，可以在相同内存预算内处理更长的序列，并在长度相同的序列中保持或提升模型准确度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的方法通过沿时间轴压缩KV缓存来解决KV缓存瓶颈的问题，但这些方法往往忽略了特征维度（即通道轴）之间的重要性差异，这限制了它们在平衡效率和模型准确度方面的能力。

**Method:** 我们提出了SPARK，这是一种无需训练的即插即用方法，通过在通道级别对KV进行非结构化稀疏化来应对现有问题，同时在注意力分数计算时动态恢复被剪枝的条目。

**Result:** 与基于逐出的方法相比，SPARK减少了KV缓存存储超过30%，即使在80%的激进剪枝比率下，其性能下降也比基准逐出方法少于5%。

**Conclusion:** SPARK通过减轻通道级冗余实现长上下文推断，与现有KV压缩量化技术正交互补，优化了模型效率和准确度之间的平衡。

**Abstract:** Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at

> 为了解决语言模型在领域知识获取上的挑战，研究提出了一种新的框架Selct2Know，该框架通过自选策略和选择性监督微调，以较低的成本达到了较好的领域知识内化效果，并在多个领域的问题解答上优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的语言模型在通用问答任务中表现出色，但在特定领域上仍面临挑战。现有的解决方案如检索增强生成方法引入外部知识但会因为噪音检索导致幻觉和延迟问题，而持续预训练虽然可以内化领域知识但成本高昂且缺乏跨领域的灵活性。

**Method:** 为了解决上述问题，作者提出了Selct2Know (S2K) 框架，它通过内部和外部知识的自选策略及选择性监督微调，以一种成本效益更高的方法内化领域知识。同时引入了结构化推理数据生成管道，并集成了GRPO以增强推理能力。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，在医学、法律和金融问题解答的基准测试上，S2K相较于现有方法有更优的表现，并且可以以显著低于领域预训练语言模型的成本达到类似的表现。

**Conclusion:** 研究提出的方法在解决特定领域问题上展示出了较现有解决方案的成本效益更高的潜力和有效性，并通过结构化数据生成和GRPO的结合进一步增强了其推理能力。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome the limitations of current methods that rely on manually designed task-specific demonstrations or curated libraries, which become increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty scale.

**Method:** Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER), a self-guided method for fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from a continually updated experience pool, aiming to improve tool usage in multi-step tasks.

**Result:** SEER achieves an average improvement of 6.1% on easy and 4.7% on hard questions on the ToolQA benchmark. On $\tau$-bench, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains of 7.44% and 23.38% with Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, respectively.

**Conclusion:** SEER improves the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs in performing multi-step tasks through dynamic, incrementally augmented experience pools, leading to better tool usage in various benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 自动语言模型在生成任务的自动评估中面临挑战，因为标准模糊不清。尽管自动生成检查表的方法可能有前景，但其实用性尚未得到充分探索。我们试图通过研究来填补这一空白。

**Method:** 我们通过六种方法生成自动检查表，并在八种不同大小的模型上评估其有效性。我们进行了成对比较和直接评分任务的实验，以分析检查表的使用效果。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，选择性地使用检查表可以在成对设置中改善评估性能，但在直接评分中的好处则不太一致。此外，我们发现即使一些与人类评分相关性低的检查表项也反映了人类编写的准则，这表明人类评估可能存在不一致性。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现强调了需要更明确地定义客观评估标准，以指导人类和自动评估。

**Abstract:** Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

> 文章介绍了VocabTailor，一种新的小型语言模型内存优化框架，它可以显著减少内存占用并保持良好的任务性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究动机源于小型语言模型（SLMs）在资源受限环境中的内存限制，尤其在边缘设备部署时，由于词汇量大而导致的内存占用过高。当前的静态词汇裁剪方法存在刚性和一刀切的问题，导致信息丢失且缺乏灵活性。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种名为VocabTailor的创新框架，该框架采取了脱耦动态词汇选择策略，通过卸载嵌入和实现LM Head的混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，实现了按需加载词汇组件。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，VocabTailor能够将词汇相关的内存使用减少高达99%，且在各种下游任务中的性能几乎无损，显著优于现有的静态词汇裁剪技术。

**Conclusion:** VocabTailor通过识别和利用词汇减少挑战中的两个关键原则，即词汇局部性和词汇相关组件计算特性间的非对称性，提供了一种有效解决内存瓶颈的方案。

**Abstract:** Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型在英语中的指令跟随能力表现出色，但在泰语等低资源语言中的表现尚待探索。现有的基准测试通常依赖于翻译，忽略了文化及领域特定的内涵，这些对于实际应用至关重要。

**Method:** 本研究开发了WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，用于评估和指令调优，覆盖四个专业领域和七种任务类型。通过多阶段质量控制过程，由标注者、领域专家和AI研究员共同创建。

**Result:** 通过零样本评估和指令调优研究（包括消融研究以隔离本国监督的影响），发现经过WangchanThaiInstruct数据集微调的模型在领域内和领域外基准测试中都优于使用翻译数据的模型。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果强调了在低资源、语言多样化的环境中，需要建立以文化和专业为基础的指令数据集，以提高语言模型的对齐效果。

**Abstract:** Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 代码切换（CS）现象在现实世界中的对话中很常见，但它给多语言语音技术带来了显著的挑战。然而，由于合适的语料库的匮乏，能够处理这种现象的系统仍然较少被探索。本文旨在解决这个问题。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种新颖的管道Universal Code-Mixer (UniCoM)，用于生成高质量且自然的代码切换样本。通过使用名为Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS) 的算法，该方法通过替换词汇的翻译来生成代码切换语音。

**Result:** 通过UniCoM，本文构建了Code-Switching FLEURS（CS-FLEURS），一种用于自动语音识别（ASR）和语音到文本翻译（S2TT）的多语言代码切换语料库。实验结果表明，CS-FLEURS在客观和主观指标上表现良好，与现有的数据集相当。

**Conclusion:** 作者的贡献致力于推动代码切换语音技术的发展，并促进更包容的多语言系统。

**Abstract:** Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管大型语言模型可以模拟专业角色，但在这些情境下全面的心理学和伦理评估仍显不足。研究旨在填补这一研究空白。

**Method:** 本文提出了EMNLP框架，用于对扮演教师角色的大语言模型进行人格剖析、道德发展阶段测量以及在软提示注入情境下的伦理风险评估。EMNLP框架扩展了现有量表，并构建了88个教师特定的道德困境，从而实现了与人类教师的职位导向比较。通过特定的软提示注入集评估大语言模型在教师角色下的合规性和脆弱性。

**Result:** 实验结果显示扮演教师角色的大语言模型展现出比人类教师更加理想化和极化的人格特质，它们在抽象道德推理方面表现出色，但在情感复杂情境下表现不佳。具备更强推理能力的模型对有害提示注入更加脆弱，揭示了能力与安全之间的悖论。此外，模型的温度和其他超参数在大多数风险行为方面的影响有限。

**Conclusion:** 该研究首次为评估扮演教师角色的大语言模型的伦理和心理一致性提供了基准，对于教育AI领域具有重要意义。

**Abstract:** Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决检索增强生成中，当检索到的上下文与LLM的参数化知识产生冲突时，无法有效解决此冲突（称为上下文-记忆冲突）的问题。

**Method:** 介绍了一种称为CARE的方法，该方法由上下文评估器和基础LLM组成，通过压缩记忆令牌嵌入，上下文评估器可以识别不可靠的上下文并引导推理朝向更可靠的知识源。

**Result:** 实验表明，CARE可以有效地缓解上下文-记忆冲突，平均提升了5.0%的问答和事实核查基准性能。

**Conclusion:** CARE作为一种有前景的方案，为构建值得信赖和适应性强的检索增强生成系统奠定了基础。

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型在处理需要时间常识推理的任务时表现不佳，因为文本中时间常识的频繁隐含性。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动提取事件时间常识的流水线，并基于SAMSum和RealNews语料库构建了TComQA数据集。

**Result:** TComQA数据集通过众包验证，在抽取时间常识方面达到了超过80%的精度，并且使用TComQA训练的模型在时间问答任务上优于现有的LLM微调模型。

**Conclusion:** 这项工作验证了LLMs在自动抽取事件时间常识方面的潜力，以及利用这些常识改进语言模型的有效性。

**Abstract:** Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To develop a pure phoneme representation model free from contextual influence for effective cross-lingual universal phoneme recognition.

**Method:** CUPE processes short, fixed-width speech windows independently and learns cross-lingual fundamental acoustic patterns with fewer parameters compared to current methods.

**Result:** CUPE demonstrates strong cross-lingual generalization in phoneme recognition, proving effective through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages and even in zero-shot settings.

**Conclusion:** Universal speech processing can be achieved through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length windows, as evidenced by CUPE's performance.

**Abstract:** Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 知识图谱往往不完整，需要知识图谱完成(KGC)方法来预测缺失元素。然而，目前的评估指标在跨多个数据集和指标性能对比时存在不足，导致无法准确评估模型的整体性能。因此，需要一个统一的元指标来解决这一问题。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种名为基于平均解距离的知识图谱评估(EDAS)的元指标，它可以整合多个数据集和评估标准下的模型性能，给出一个标准化分数。

**Result:** 实验表明，EDAS元指标能有效整合多种评估指标和数据集下的性能，并在统一的排名中反映出模型的性能，为KGC模型提供了一个一致、可靠且通用的评估框架。

**Conclusion:** EDAS提供了一种全局视角，支持更加明智的模型选择，并促进了跨数据集评估的公平性。

**Abstract:** Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

**Abstract:** In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

> 为了解决MLLMs可信度问题，文章提出了MultiTrust-X这一全面基准，用于评估、分析和缓解问题，实验揭示了潜在风险，并提出了一个推理增强的安全对齐方法（RESA）来解决这些问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管多模态大规模语言模型（MLLMs）的能力取得了显著进步，但其可信度仍是一个严重关切。现有的评估和缓解方法往往聚焦于狭窄的方面，并忽视了多模态引入的风险。为了解决这些问题，

**Method:** 我们提出了MultiTrust-X，这是一个全面的基准，用于评估、分析和减轻MLLMs的可信度问题。它包括一个三维框架，涵盖五个可信度方面（真实性、健壮性、安全性、公平性和隐私性）；两种新型风险类型（多模态风险和跨模态影响）；以及来自数据、模型架构、训练和推理算法的多个缓解策略。

**Result:** MultiTrust-X基准包括32个任务和28个精选数据集，全面覆盖了30个开源和专有的MLLMs，并对8种代表性的缓解方法进行了深入分析。实验结果揭示了现有模型在可信度和一般能力之间的差距，以及基础LLMs在多模态训练和推理过程中潜在风险的放大问题。

**Conclusion:** 通过广泛的实验，揭示了现有模型的重大漏洞，包括可信度与一般能力之间的差距，以及基础LLMs在多模态训练和推理过程中潜在风险的放大。此外，我们还发现现有的缓解策略存在关键限制，虽然某些方法在某些方面有所改善，但很少能有效解决整体可信度，且很多会导致意外的权衡，从而损害模型的实用性。据此，我们提出了一个推理增强的安全对齐方法（RESA），它使模型能够发现潜在风险，并取得了最先进的结果。

**Abstract:** The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### [28] [Confidence-Modulated Speculative Decoding for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15371)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种基于置信度调制起草的信息论框架，通过动态调整推测生成的数量减少重做频率，提高资源利用并保持输出质量，实验显示在速度上显著提高，输出质量得以保持或提高。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的推测解码方法依赖于静态的起草长度和刚性的验证标准，这限制了其在不同模型不确定性和输入复杂性下的适应性。为解决这些问题，本文提出了一个新的推测解码框架。

**Method:** 通过基于熵和范围不确定性的置信度调制起草方法，本文提出了一种信息论框架。该方法能够根据起草器输出分布上的不确定性动态调整每次迭代中推测生成的令牌数量。此外，还利用相同的置信度信号来调整验证过程，使其更加灵活地接受起草令牌，而不影响生成质量。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，在机器翻译和摘要生成任务上，相对于标准的推测解码方法，该方法显著提高了速度，同时保持或提高了BLEU和ROUGE分数。

**Conclusion:** 该方法提供了一种在不确定性变化条件下实现高效和稳健解码的原则性和可插拔的方法。

**Abstract:** Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

Main category: cs.CL

> A study shows that larger vocabularies reduce tokenized text complexity and improve language models' performance primarily by lowering uncertainty on the most frequent words.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To understand the source of the benefit of large vocabularies in language models.

**Method:** conduct a controlled study that scales the language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and optimization fixed. They quantify the complexity of tokenized text using Kolmogorov complexity and conduct a word-level loss decomposition.

**Result:** Larger vocabularies reduce the complexity of tokenized text and primarily lower uncertainty on the most frequent words. Constraining input and output embedding norms reverses the gain, indicating that the model exploits token-frequency imbalance. The frequent-word benefit transfers to downstream benchmarks.

**Conclusion:** Enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same frequent-word benefit. The results reframe the advantage of larger vocabularies as lowering the complexity of tokenized text, which helps in tokenizer-model co-design and clarifies the loss dynamics in language model scaling.

**Abstract:** Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

**Abstract:** The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

> 本文介绍了MCR-BENCH，一个评估LALMs处理不一致音频-文本对时如何优先处理信息的全面基准。研究发现，当存在模态间不一致时，LALMs表现出强烈的向文本输入偏见，降低音频中心任务的表现，引发了可靠性担忧。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管大型语音-语言模型（LALMs）能够有效处理和理解结合音频和文本的多模态输入，但关于其在处理音频和文本模态间冲突信息时的表现还没有得到充分研究。

**Method:** 通过对广泛多样的音频理解任务进行评估；研究文本偏差的影响因素；通过监督微调探索缓解策略；分析模型确信度模式。

**Result:** 

**Conclusion:** 强调了在训练过程中需要改善模态平衡，并采用更复杂的融合机制来增强处理冲突多模态输入的鲁棒性。项目可在https://github.com/WangCheng0116/MCR-BENCH获得。

**Abstract:** Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于架构的碎片化和透明度不足，大语音语言模型的发展受到了阻碍。现有的语音语言模型研究中，通常只发布模型参数而缺少训练数据和配置，导致研究无法系统比较和复现。

**Method:** 引入了LLaSO，这是一个完全开放的大规模语音语言模型端到端框架，提供了三个关键资源：1) LLaSO-Align，一个1200万实例的语音文本对齐语料库；2) LLaSO-Instruct，一个1350万实例的多任务指令调优数据集；3) LLaSO-Eval，一个可重复生成的标准化评估基准。

**Result:** 基于我们的公开数据训练并发布的LLaSO-Base参考模型，取得了0.72的标准化评分，建立了可重复的强基线，超越了可比模型。实验表明，虽然更广泛的训练覆盖可以提升表现，但在未见任务中，尤其是在纯音频场景中，依然存在显著的推广差距。

**Conclusion:** LLaSO确立了开放标准，统一了研究努力方向，加快了社区主导的大规模语音语言模型研究进展。此框架包括代码、数据集、预训练模型及结果。

**Abstract:** The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

**Conclusion:** 研究结果为隐私保护语言模型领域的进一步研究提供了有价值的见解和未来研究方向。

**Abstract:** Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights

**Motivation:** 研究的动机是解决不同语言中非等值词汇导致的理解困难，尤其是文化、传统、食物、服装等方面的词汇，这些词汇在目标语言中往往没有直接的等值词汇。

**Method:** 该研究采用基于图书馆的研究方法，重点在于从源语言到目标语言的专业转换非等值词汇的方法和规则。研究中转换了25个非等值词汇从Dar和乌兹别克语到英语和俄语。

**Result:** 研究结果包括了不同语言中非等值词汇的专业转换规则和方法，并转换了25个词汇。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明了非等值词汇从源语言到目标语言的专业转换方法和规则，但仍有大量词汇需要进一步转换。

**Abstract:** These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

**Motivation:** 为了使可编程的任务导向对话（TOD）代理在遵循结构化对话策略方面表现准确，研究提出了一种名为PyTOD的代理，旨在提高状态跟踪的准确性。

**Method:** PyTOD采用了一种简单的受限解码方法，通过语言模型而非语法规则来遵循API模式，以此来跟踪对话状态并利用策略和执行反馈进行高效的错误校正。

**Result:** 实验表明，PyTOD在具有挑战性的SGD基准测试中实现了状态跟踪性能的最先进水平，并在准确性以及在对话过程中对用户目标的鲁棒估计方面超过了强大的基线表现。

**Conclusion:** 研究展示了执行感知状态跟踪的有效性，PyTOD在提高对话代理状态跟踪准确性方面有所突破。

**Abstract:** Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

**Motivation:** 当前方法要么产生粗糙的整体评分，要么依赖于不透明的黑盒模型，限制了它们在临床工作流程中的实用性。

**Method:** RadReason框架，基于Group Relative Policy Optimization，包括两个关键创新：（1）次分数动态加权，根据实时F1统计自适应地优先考虑临床挑战性更大的错误类型；（2）多数指导优势缩放，根据次分数一致性调整策略梯度更新。

**Result:** 在ReXVal基准上的实验表明，RadReason超过了所有已有的离线指标，达到了与GPT-4评估相当的水平，同时保持了解释性、成本效益和临床部署的适用性。

**Conclusion:** RadReason通过更稳定的优化方法和与专家临床判断更好的对齐，展示了超越现有工具并达到与GPT-4评估相当性能的能力，同时保持了可解释性、成本效益，且适合临床应用。

**Abstract:** Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本研究旨在通过开发智能且基于数据的方法来提升个性化营销的效果，特别是优化个性化优惠的生成。研究表明，有效的个性化策略可以提高企业的收入高达40％，因此，开发能够生成更加个性化的优惠的智能模型具有重要的战略意义。

**Method:** 此论文介绍了一种名为SLM4Offer的个性化优惠生成生成式AI模型，该模型基于对比学习方法对Google的T5-Small 60M预训练编码器-解码器语言模型进行了微调。SLM4Offer使用InfoNCE损失将客户画像与相关的优惠在共享嵌入空间中对齐。该模型的一个关键创新在于通过对比损失引入自适应学习行为，这在训练过程中重塑了潜在空间并提高了模型的泛化能力。

**Result:** 模型通过采用对抗学习目标，在模拟客户行为和优惠接受模式的合成数据集上进行了微调和评估。实验结果表明，SLM4Offer相比监督微调基线，优惠接受率提高了17％，这表明对比学习目标在个性化营销中发挥了重要作用。

**Conclusion:** 研究得出结论，通过采用对比学习目标进行训练，可以显著提高生成个性化优惠相关模型的性能，而SLM4Offer模型显示了通过这种方式提高客户优惠接受率的潜力。

**Abstract:** Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

**Motivation:** 质疑大型语言模型能否有效适应用户行为的异质性和个性化偏好。

**Method:** 引入面向异质性的集群训练方法（HeTLM），解决单一语言模型参数设定不能有效捕捉用户行为和偏好的问题。

**Result:** 实验发现，以页面级分词器训练的小规模语言模型优于大型预训练语言模型或微调后的模型；HeTLM相较于同参数量级的单一语言模型表现更好，且生成效果的平均值更高、波动更低。

**Conclusion:** 通过对异质性集群的训练，HeTLM能够提升个性化行为捕捉的效率和效果，并降低生成性能的波动。

**Abstract:** A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved

> 研究用模型中心的难度概念进行课程学习对语言模型预训练的影响，结果显示可以显著提升模型性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 探索在语言模型预训练中，用基于模型中心的难度概念取代传统的人类中心难度指标进行课程学习是否会更有竞争力。

**Method:** 通过使用训练数据影响力（一种估计单个训练样本对模型输出影响的分数）来排序训练样本，替代传统的基于人类视角的难度指标，从而制定新的教学计划。

**Result:** 在基准测试中，使用新的教学计划训练的模型比随机顺序训练的模型提高了超过10个百分点，证明了课程学习对于语言模型预训练是有益的。

**Conclusion:** 课程学习对于语言模型预训练是有益的，前提是采用更符合模型视角的难度概念。

**Abstract:** Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 小语言模型(SLMs)提供了计算效率和可访问性，但对其性能和环境影响的系统评估仍然不足。

**Method:** 我们引入了SLM-Bench，这是一个专门设计来从小模型的语言模型(SLMs)的性能和环境影响多个维度进行评估的基准。SLM-Bench对15种SLMs在9种NLP任务上使用23个数据集进行了评估，这些数据集涵盖了14个不同的领域。评估在4种硬件配置上进行，提供了这些模型有效性的严格比较。与之前的基准测试不同，SLM-Bench量化了11个涵盖正确性、计算和消耗的指标，使得可以全面评估效率权衡。

**Result:** 我们的评估在控制硬件条件的基础上进行，确保了模型间的公平比较。我们开发了一个开源基准测试管线，带有标准化的评估协议，以促进可复制性和进一步的研究。

**Conclusion:** 我们的研究发现突出了SLMs之间的多样化权衡：一些模型在准确性方面表现出色，而另一些模型则在能源效率方面实现了优越性。SLM-Bench为SLMs的评估树立了一个新的标准，弥合了资源效率与实际应用之间的差距。

**Abstract:** Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的群体和身份检测数据集主要是英语中心的，单标签且专注于粗略的身份类别。因此，该项目旨在填补希伯来语语料库在社会身份检测中的空白。

**Method:** 介绍HebID，这是一个用于社会身份检测的多标签希伯来语语料库，包含5,536个来自以色列政客Facebook帖子（2018年12月至2021年4月）的句子，手动标注了12个细致的社会身份。

**Result:** 研究发现，经过希伯来语调优的大规模语言模型表现最佳（宏观$F_1$ = 0.74）。

**Conclusion:** HebID为研究希伯来语中的社会身份提供了全面的基础，并为其他非英语政治环境中的类似研究提供了模型。

**Abstract:** Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

**Motivation:** 旨在开发一种比现有扩散语言模型更强大的开放扩散大型语言模型，特别是在一般任务、数学和编码任务上。

**Method:** Dream 7B 使用离散扩散建模方法平行地通过迭代去噪来优化序列，与自回归模型的顺序生成不同。训练技巧包括基于自回归的大型语言模型初始化和上下文相关的令牌级噪声重排。

**Result:** 在一般任务、数学任务和编码任务上，Dream 7B 优于现有的扩散语言模型。它显示出更强的规划能力和推断灵活性，包括任意顺序生成、填空能力和可调节的质量-速度权衡。

**Conclusion:** Dream 7B 证明了离散扩散建模在生成语言任务中的强大能力，发布了 Dream-Base 和 Dream-Instruct 供进一步研究使用。

**Abstract:** We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct

**Motivation:** 该研究的动机是进行首次大规模计算研究，重点关注政治不合法化的讨论(PDD)，即对政治实体的规范有效性发起象征性攻击。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种两阶段分类流水线，结合了微调后的编码模型和解码LLMs。

**Result:** 通过引入DictaLM 2.0，达到了0.74的F1分数用于PDD的二元检测，并且在PDD特征分类上达到了0.67的宏观F1分数。研究发现，PDD在过去三个十年间显著增加，社交媒体上的PDD比例高于议会辩论，右倾人士在政治选举和重大政治事件期间表现出使用PDD的更加强烈的倾向。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，自动化PDD分析对于理解民主讨论的可行性和价值。

**Abstract:** We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

**Conclusion:** SafetyFlow系统提供了一种全自动构建大语言模型安全基准的方法，显著提高了效率和成本可控性，为未来更高效的安全评估奠定了基础。

**Abstract:** The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但仍易受到诱导生成有害内容的牢房破解攻击。本文发现LLMs作为鉴别器能够更有效地识别有害请求，但作为生成器时防御则显得不足，因此探索对齐其内在的识别和生成能力。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种名为SDGO（Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization）的强化学习框架，该框架利用模型自身的辨别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自我改进来提升生成的安全性。此方法在训练阶段不需要任何额外的标注数据或外部模型。

**Result:** 大量的实验表明，与提示词和训练基线相比，SDGO显著提升了模型的安全性，同时在通用基准上仍保持了帮助性。方案对分布外（OOD）牢房破解攻击呈现出鲁棒的性能。

**Conclusion:** 通过调整LLMs的鉴别和生成能力，SDGO实现了这两种能力的紧密耦合，使生成能力在只有少量鉴别样本的情况下得到了进一步增强。代码和数据集可在https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO获得。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

**Motivation:** 当前学术文献迅速增长，人工编写科学研究综述变得越来越不切实际。同时，大语言模型（LLMs）在自动化编写综述方面表现出潜力，但由于缺乏标准化的基准和评估协议，这一领域的发展受到了阻碍。为了填补这一空白，进行了这项研究。

**Method:** 此研究建立了一个名为SurGE（Survey Generation Evaluation）的新基准，用于评估计算机科学领域中科学调查报告的生成。它包括测试实例集合和一个大型学术论文集合。测试实例集合包含主题描述、专家撰写的调查报告及其引用的所有文献。大型学术论文集合包含超过一百万篇论文，用作检索池。此外，研究还提出了一种自动化评估框架，从信息覆盖率、引用准确性、结构组织和内容质量四个维度来衡量生成的调查报告。

**Result:** 研究对多种基于大语言模型（LLMs）的方法进行了评估，显示出生成调查报告仍然具有很高的挑战性，即使对于先进的自我反思框架也是如此。

**Conclusion:** 研究发现，生成科学调查报告是一个复杂而具有挑战性的任务，需要持续进行研究，以改进现有方法和技术。此外，研究将开源所有代码、数据和模型。

**Abstract:** Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

**Motivation:** 虽然先前的研究试图通过修改导致位置偏差出现的架构来减轻其影响，但显著的位置偏差仍然存在。为有效应对位置偏差，提出了Pos2Distill。

**Method:** 引入名为Pos2Distill的位置到位置的知识蒸馏框架，该框架旨在通过将优势位置的能力转移到不太有利的位置来减少性能差距。针对检索和推理范式下位置偏差的不同表现，设计了两种专门的实例化方法：Pos2Distill-R¹和Pos2Distill-R²。

**Result:** 采用Pos2Distill方法实现了对长上下文检索和推理任务中所有上下文位置上的性能提升和增强的均匀性。同时，两种专门系统在各自的任务中表现出色，且展示了良好的跨任务泛化能力。

**Conclusion:** 通过引入Pos2Distill框架，有效减少了长上下文情景中的位置偏差，显著提高任务性能，并确保了跨任务的良好泛化能力。

**Abstract:** Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

**Conclusion:** 论文提倡开发健壮的孟加拉语词干提取器，并继续在该领域进行研究以提高语言分析和处理的效果。

**Abstract:** Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

**Motivation:** 由于现有的数据集在规模和设计上都有局限性，难以系统地研究电商平台上的多种产品图片是否总是增强产品理解。为此，研究者创建了一个新的数据集EcomMMMU，来分析这一问题。

**Method:** 研究人员创建了一个名为EcomMMMU的新数据集，其中包含406,190个样本和8,989,510张图片，该数据集包含了8个基础任务以及用于评估MLLMs使用视觉内容能力的VSS子集。此外，研究还提出了SUMEI方法，通过预测图片的效用来改进其在下游任务中的使用。

**Result:** 该研究通过引入EcomMMMU数据集，发现电商平台上的多种产品图片并不总是能提升产品理解能力，有时反而会降低效率。研究还提出了SUMEI方法，通过预测图片的有效性来改进多模态大语言模型在电商任务中的应用。

**Conclusion:** 研究通过EcomMMMU数据集得出，产品图片并非总是有利于理解产品，有时甚至会降低性能。提出了SUMEI数据驱动的方法，证明了其在多图像使用中的有效性和鲁棒性。

**Abstract:** E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于知识缺口和幻觉现象，医疗大型语言模型的准确诊断变得困难。检索和工具增强方法虽有所帮助，但外部知识利用不强且反馈推理可追溯性差。因此，作者提出了解决这一挑战的方法。

**Method:** 引入了Deep-DxSearch，一种通过强化学习（RL）端到端训练的代理RAG系统，以实现可追踪的检索增强推理，从而改善医疗诊断。系统构建了一个包含病历和可靠医学知识来源的大规模医疗检索语料库，用以支持跨诊断场景的检索感知推理。将LLM视为核心代理，检索语料库视为其环境，通过定制奖励在格式、检索、推理结构和诊断准确性方面训练代理RAG策略。

**Result:** 训练后的Deep-DxSearch在诊断准确性方面实现了显著增长，超过了GPT-4o、DeepSeek-R1和其他医疗特定框架，无论是在分布内还是分布外设置中，对常见和罕见疾病的诊断都有所改善。消融研究证实了奖励设计和检索语料库组件的重要性。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，端到端代理强化学习训练框架在多个数据集中始终优于提示工程和无需训练的RAG方法。奖励设计和检索语料库组件的消融研究表明，它们在提高诊断准确性方面发挥了关键作用。案例研究和可解释性分析揭示了Deep-DxSearch在诊断策略上的改进，为临床医生提供了更可靠和精确的初步诊断。

**Abstract:** Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional

*Yufeng Zhao,Junnan Liu,Hongwei Liu,Dongsheng Zhu,Yuan Shen,Songyang Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

> The study introduces ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark, and two new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) across various reasoning tasks. Results show TIR-improved models perform better and are more efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in precise computations and understand if Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) improves reasoning behavior, the paper introduces a new benchmark and metrics.

**Method:** The authors propose ReasonZoo, a benchmark with nine reasoning categories, and metrics PAC and AUC-PCC to test TIR. They assess the performance and efficiency of models with and without TIR.

**Result:** TIR-enabled models outperform their non-TIR equivalents in both categories of tasks and show enhanced reasoning efficiency through improved PAC and AUC-PCC scores.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate that TIR has a positive impact on the reasoning abilities of LLMs and could potentially be a significant step forward in handling complex reasoning tasks.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

**Conclusion:** LiveMCP-101设定了评估现实世界代理能力的严格标准，推动了通过工具使用可靠执行复杂任务的自主AI系统的研发。

**Abstract:** Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

**Motivation:** 论文的动机是对长期使用Soft-argmax的选择进行重新审视，证明Soft-argmax并非实现强劲性能的唯一途径。

**Method:** 该论文提出了一个基于经典结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，而不是常用的Soft-argmax方法。

**Result:** 该方法在WFLW、COFW和300W三个面部地标基准上取得了最先进的性能，训练速度提高了2.2倍，并且精度更高或具有竞争力。

**Conclusion:** 通过替代的训练目标，该方法能够在面部地标检测中达到最先进的性能，同时提高训练效率。

**Abstract:** Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available

*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

> YOPO achieves superior performance in 9-DoF pose estimation using only RGB images, outperforming existing methods and achieving results comparable to more complex RGB-D systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To simplify pose recovery for unseen instances within specific categories from a single RGB image without relying on additional data types like CAD models or multi-stage processes.

**Method:** YOPO, a single-stage, query-based framework that extends 2D detection to category-level 9-DoF pose estimation using a transformer detector with a lightweight pose head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost.

**Result:** Sets a new state of the art on three benchmarks, achieving 79.6% IoU50 and 54.1% under the 10°10cm metric on the REAL275 dataset, surpassing previous RGB-only methods and narrowing the gap to RGB-D systems.

**Conclusion:** YOPO demonstrates that high-performance object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation can be unified using only RGB images and category-level pose labels, aligning with the motivation for a simpler, yet effective approach.

**Abstract:** Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的面部识别系统分别处理物理呈现攻击和数字伪造攻击，这增加了系统的复杂性和推理延迟，并使系统暴露在组合攻击向量之下。

**Method:** 我们提出了一个名为Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework的统一训练方法，该方法利用自动匹配的真实和攻击性自拍照对来学习模态无关的活体识别线索。

**Result:** 在第6届面部防伪挑战统一物理数字攻击检测基准测试中，我们的方法达到了2.10%的平均分类错误率，优于之前的解决方案。

**Conclusion:** 该框架计算量轻（4.46 GFLOPs），训练时间不到一个小时，适合在实际环境中部署。代码和预训练模型可在https://github.com/xPONYx/iccv2025_deepfake_challenge获取。

**Abstract:** Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的隐秘视觉感知策略大多旨在减少不确定性，但它们通常局限于掩码域，RGB域的潜力未被充分探索。

**Method:** 一种名为RUN++的可逆展开网络，结合生成改进，将隐秘视觉感知任务视为数学优化问题并将其展开为多阶段的深度网络，包含可逆对象区域提取（CORE）、上下文感知区域增强（CARE）和噪声增强微调（FINE）三个模块。

**Result:** RUN++通过针对不确定区域引入伯努利扩散模型，显著减少了误报和漏报，提升了隐秘视觉感知效果。

**Conclusion:** RUN++不仅展示了在轻松处理不确定性的能力，还提出了一种构建健壮隐秘视觉感知系统的全新范式，适用于现实世界的退化情况。

**Abstract:** Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

> CurveFlow, a flow matching method with curvature regularization, shows superior performance in text-to-image generation, achieving better semantic consistency and image quality than existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To investigate the correlation between trajectory curvature and semantic alignment of generated images to their captions, proposing a method to optimize text-to-image generation.

**Method:** CurveFlow, a flow matching framework, learns smooth, non-linear trajectories with a curvature regularization technique to improve semantic alignment in text-to-image generation.

**Result:** Experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017 show that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming standard rectified flow variants and other baselines in semantic consistency metrics.

**Conclusion:** Curvature-aware modeling enhances the model's ability to generate images that are semantically consistent with captions, maintaining high image quality.

**Abstract:** Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）取得了显著进展，但数据集偏差和对主观标签的依赖继续阻碍了其泛化性能。

**Method:** 提出了一种无监督的、不依赖主观评分的框架HiRQA（分层排序和质量对齐），通过结合排序和对比学习提供分层的质量感知嵌入。该框架在推理时仅使用输入图像来预测质量分数。引入了一种新型的高阶排序损失，通过失真对之间的关系排序监督质量预测，同时嵌入距离损失确保了特征距离和感知差异之间的一致性。训练时的对比对齐损失进一步增强了学习到的表示，该损失由结构化文本提示指导。

**Result:** 仅在合成失真上训练，HiRQA 对真实退化表现出有效的泛化能力。HiRQA-S 轻量级版本的推理时间为每张图像仅 3.5 毫秒。实验表明，HiRQA 在合成和真实基准上的性能达到了最先进水平，其强大的泛化能力和扩展性得到了验证。

**Conclusion:** 该方法展示了一种新颖的无参考图像质量评估方法，展示了良好的泛化能力和实时部署可行性。

**Abstract:** Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

**Conclusion:** 论文表明，提出的策略可以保证即使在摄像头易受时空相关中断的情况下，多视角3D重建也能满足质量要求。

**Abstract:** Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

**Method:** XDR-LVLM框架结合医疗视觉编码器、视觉语言大型模型核心以及多任务提示工程和多阶段微调技术，以理解眼底图像中的病理特征并生成详细的诊断报告。

**Result:** 实验结果显示XDR-LVLM在糖尿病视网膜病变数据集（DDR）上达到84.55%的均衡准确率和79.92%的F1分数，概念检测方面也表现出色，具体为77.95%的均衡准确率和66.88%的F1分数。此外，人类评估证实了生成解释的流畅性、准确性和临床实用性。

**Conclusion:** XDR-LVLM展示了通过提供健壮且可解释的见解来弥合自动化诊断与临床需求之间差距的能力。

**Abstract:** Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 缺乏逼真的纹理限制了城市网格模型在虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶中的应用。

**Method:** MeSS方法通过三个阶段生成室外场景：几何一致的稀疏视图生成、更密集的中间视图传播、全局消除视觉不一致性。同时结合3D高斯洒点场景重建。

**Result:** 该方法在几何对齐和生成质量上表现出色。

**Conclusion:** 合成的场景可以通过重光照和风格转移技术以多种风格渲染。

**Abstract:** Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

**Method:** 我们提出了一种基于学习的方法来推导规则基础代理的对抗行为，以引发失败场景。

**Conclusion:** 这项研究表明，通过学习衍生对抗行为可以有效降低性能，这对于加强鲁棒性至关重要。

**Abstract:** Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

**Abstract:** Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

**Abstract:** Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 为了实现全方位利用多模态数据进行3D建模，并解决现有模型在单模态操作或者局限于3D结构中的限制，导致培训数据集范围受限的问题。

**Method:** 通过引入协作多模态编码来整合模态特定特征，同时保持各自的代表性优势，并通过辅助2D和3D监督提升多模态编码的健壮性和性能。基于嵌入的多模态码使用三平面潜扩散模型生成纹理和几何细节优越的3D资产。

**Result:** 通过多个知名数据集进行的广泛实验表明，相较于其他模型，TriMM可以利用少量训练数据达到相匹的性能。另外，在最近的RGB-D数据集上的额外实验进一步验证了TriMM融入其他多模态数据集到3D生成的潜力。

**Conclusion:** TriMM通过有效利用多模态数据的优势，即便使用的是少量训练数据，也可以实现更好的3D生成效果，证明了对于少量数据的高效利用能力。

**Abstract:** 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

**Method:** 本文提出了一种基于中心导向原型对比聚类框架，该框架包括一个软原型对比模块和一个双重一致性学习模块。软原型对比模块使用样本属于簇中心的概率作为权重来计算每类的原型，从而避免了类间冲突并减少了原型漂移。双重一致性学习模块分别对同一样本的不同变换和不同样本的邻域进行对齐，确保了特征具有变换不变的语义信息和紧密的簇内分布，为原型的计算提供了可靠保证。

**Result:** 在五个数据集上的实验表明，提出的方法有效，优于其他最先进的方法。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明，所提方法在五个数据集上的表现优于现有方法，代码已公开。

**Abstract:** Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于无人机的轨迹较长和操作性复杂，无人机视觉语言导航(UAV-VLN)的可靠性能具有挑战性，往往需要人类干预或详细指令。为了解决这一问题，本论文提出了一个新的任务——双海拔无人机协作视觉语言导航（DuAl-VLN）。

**Method:** 在这一任务中，提出了双无人机协作视觉语言导航框架AeroDuo。高海拔无人机整合多模态大语言模型(Pilot-LLM)用于目标推理，低海拔无人机采用轻量级多阶段策略进行导航和目标定位。两架无人机协同工作，仅交换最少的坐标信息以确保效率。

**Result:** 创建了包含13,838个高-低海拔无人机合作轨迹的HaL-13k数据集，每个轨迹都有目标导向的语言指令，并通过该数据集系统地评估了模型在新型环境和陌生目标上的泛化能力。

**Conclusion:** 通过双无人机协作框架AeroDuo，研究展示了一种有效的方法来利用无人机动特性进行复杂环境下的导航，并展示了该方法在HaL-13k数据集上的性能。

**Abstract:** Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

**Motivation:** 目的是解决扩散模型在生成任务中的序列生成过程耗时较长的问题，并探讨原始扩散过程是否可以通过不依赖非马尔可夫过程实现相同效率。

**Method:** 引入了跳步采样机制，这是一种在迭代生成过程中跳过多个中间去噪步骤的方法，与标准扩散推理的逐步细化不同。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，该方法在流行的预训练扩散模型上实现了高质量的生成，并显著减少了采样步骤。

**Conclusion:** 证实了通过跳步采样机制提升扩散模型效率是一种内在属性，并表明该方法整合了加速采样技术和DDIM，实现了高质量生成和更快的采样速度。

**Abstract:** Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

**Result:** Extensive experiments show that Comp-X can efficiently understand coding requests and has impressive interactive capabilities, while maintaining comparable compression performance.

**Conclusion:** Comp-X provides a promising approach for AGI in image compression by integrating the interactive and adaptive capabilities of LLMs into the coding process, showcasing a new avenue for intelligent compression systems.

**Abstract:** We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的车道拓扑推理方法通常采用先检测再推理的策略，这会导致拓扑推理性能受限于检测阶段的一对一分配结果。本文旨在通过引入冗余分配策略，实现数量丰富、几何多样化的拓扑监督，提高拓扑推理的整体性能。

**Method:** 本文提出了RATopo（冗余分配策略）用于车道拓扑推理。通过重新构造Transformer解码器，交换了交叉注意力层和自注意力层的位置，保留了冗余车道预测以实现有效的多对一分配。同时，建立了多个具有独立参数的并行交叉注意力块，进一步增强了检测到的车道的多样性。

**Result:** 在OpenLane-V2数据集上的广泛实验表明，RATopo能够广泛应用于现有的拓扑推理框架中，有效地提升车道间以及车道与交通元素之间拓扑关系的推理性能。

**Conclusion:** RATopo策略能够兼容多种模型并提升拓扑推理的质量，证明了冗余分配方法在车道拓扑推理任务中的有效性。

**Abstract:** Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The traditional reliance on patent images for tasks such as classification and retrieval is limited due to the images' inability to convey comprehensive visual and semantic information, often leading to ambiguities in prior art searches. This work aims to address these limitations.

**Method:** In this work, the authors develop a unified framework called DesignCLIP utilizing vision-language models, specifically CLIP, to enhance the analysis of design patents. DesignCLIP includes class-aware classification and contrastive learning techniques, making use of detailed captions for patent images and learning from multiple viewpoints.

**Result:** Experiments conducted by the authors showed that DesignCLIP outperformed both baseline and state-of-the-art models across various tasks including patent classification and retrieval.

**Conclusion:** This research highlights the potential of multimodal approaches in advancing patent analysis, offering a more reliable and accurate AI-driven solution for design patents.

**Abstract:** In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 动机在于解决现有方法存在的问题，如忽略时间信息、仅限于二分类任务以及不考虑预测校准问题。

**Method:** TPA方法包括从视频帧中提取特征、通过可训练的时间提取器聚集特征以捕捉心脏运动，并通过margin-hinge对比损耗与特定类别的文本提示对齐。同时引入CVAESM模块来增强预测校准。

**Result:** 在私有CHD检测数据集和公共EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上，TPA在CHD诊断中的宏观F1得分达到85.40%，降低了预期校准误差和自适应ECE，且在三项分类任务中提升了宏观F1得分。

**Conclusion:** TPA是一个整合了时间建模、prompt-aware对比学习和不确定性量化的心脏超声视频CHD分类框架。

**Abstract:** Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

**Abstract:** Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first

with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于现有的方法需要大量的训练和计算资源，且依赖高质量的提示来生成精确的掩码，该研究旨在提出一种可以有效生成COD任务中的掩码的方法，以减少人工成本和提高效率。

**Method:** 该研究提出了一种无需训练的两阶段方法RAG-SEG，首先通过检索增强生成(RAG)产生粗略的掩码作为提示，然后利用SAM模型进行精修。

**Result:** 实验表明，RAG-SEG在不进行传统训练的情况下，保持了竞争力的性能，并且所有实验在个人笔记本电脑上完成，显示了其计算效率和实用性。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明，RAG-SEG在标准的COD数据集上表现出与现有最佳方法相当或更好的性能，并且可以在个人笔记本电脑上运行，突显了其计算效率和实用性。

**Abstract:** Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

**Motivation:** 由于 T2V 扩散模型可能被滥用于生成有害或误导性内容，提出 VideoEraser 防止生成指定的不良内容，即使用户明确要求这些内容。

**Method:** Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) 和 Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG) 双阶段过程，设计为可在代表性 T2V 扩散模型中无缝集成的即插即用模块。

**Result:** 进行了四项任务（对象去除、艺术风格去除、名人去除和显式内容去除）的广泛评估，结果显示，VideoEraser 在抑制不良内容方面达到最先进水平，且在四个任务上平均比基线方法降低46%的不想要的内容。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明，VideoEraser 在有效性、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面均优于先前方法，平均抑制不良内容的表现优于基线方法46%。

**Abstract:** The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本文旨在通过系统的实证研究来填补现有的Video-LLMs在理解其内部机制方面的空白。现有的大多数工作都着重于提高性能，而忽略了对内部机制的理解。

**Method:** 本文采用了注意力剔除的方法为主要分析工具，设计了三种变体：视频时间剔除、视频空间剔除和语言到视频剔除。这些方法被应用于不同数量的层（窗口层）上。通过仔细控制窗口层数和剔除类型，我们提供了两种设置：全局设置和细粒度设置。

**Result:** 本研究揭示了三个关键发现：1) 全局设置表明视频信息提取主要发生在早期层，形成了一个两阶段过程——较低层专注于感知编码，较高层处理抽象推理。2) 在细粒度设置下，某些中间层对视频问答产生了显著影响，作为关键异常值，而大多数其他层则起的作用很小。3) 在两种设置下，我们观察到时空建模更多依赖于语言引导的检索，而不是视频帧内的自我注意力，尽管后者有很高的计算成本。

**Conclusion:** 本文系统地揭示了Video-LLMs如何内部处理和理解视频内容，提供了未来研究的可解释性和效率视角。此外，这些发现还可以用来减少Video-LLMs中的注意力计算。

**Abstract:** Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

**Motivation:** 传统的迁移学习方法在更新所有模型参数时可能会导致过拟合和增加计算成本。BioTune旨在通过对相关层子集进行精细调整来优化模型性能，同时减少可训练参数的数量，提高效率。

**Method:** BioTune采用了一种进化算法来识别需要精细调整的层子集，以优化特定目标任务上的模型性能。

**Conclusion:** BioTune通过集中对相关层进行精细调整，减少了可训练参数的数量，降低了计算成本，并使跨多样数据特征和分布的迁移学习更有效。

**Abstract:** Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) compression methods that can only compress medium-scale scenes to the megabyte range and lack mechanisms for accommodating scene changes after long-term archival.

**Method:** Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) improves quantization efficiency by exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and using shared codebooks across all training scenes, and conditions scene decoding on images captured at decoding time.

**Result:** The approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3D GS to the kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes.

**Conclusion:** ICGS-Quantizer is an effective solution for 3DGS compression, significantly enhancing compression efficiency and providing adaptability to post-archival scene changes.

**Abstract:** 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的基于3D高斯散射的方法在应对驾驶场景中的运动模糊问题时，采用了动态和静态成分的分离策略，但忽略了背景的几何关系优化，仅仅通过添加高斯来拟合每个训练视图，导致模型对新视图的渲染鲁棒性不足且几何表示不准确。

**Method:** DriveSplat是一种基于神经高斯表示的高质量重建方法，专用于驾驶场景中的动态-静态分解。该方法采用分区域的体素初始化方案，将场景划分为近、中、远三个区域，以增强近距离细节的表达。此外，引入了可变形神经高斯模型来模拟非刚性动态角色，其参数由可学习的变形网络随时间调整。整个框架通过来自预训练模型的深度和法线先验来监督，以提升几何结构的准确性。

**Result:** 该方法在Waymo和KITTI数据集上进行了严格评估，展示了在驾驶场景中新视图合成方面的最先进性能。

**Conclusion:** DriveSplat在解决驾驶场景中的3D场景重建问题上提供了一种新的方法，通过动态-静态分离、分区域体素初始化和可变形神经高斯，提升了新视图合成中的几何结构准确性和近距离细节表现。

**Abstract:** In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

**Motivation:** 本文的动机是通过解决RPM问题来提升机器智能的抽象推理能力，因为尽管当前深度学习模型在各种领域中表现出色，但在抽象推理方面仍存在根本性的瓶颈。

**Method:** 该方法从因果链建模的视角系统地分析了RPM任务中的完整因果链，并基于此分析设计了基线模型DIO的网络架构。然而，优化目标的设定未能使模型真正掌握预定义的人类推理逻辑。为了解决这个问题，本文逐步提出了三种改进方法。

**Result:** 实验表明，改进方法能够部分解决原有方法的不足，但并未完全解决优化目标设定对其推理逻辑掌握的影响。具体的实验结果未在摘要中详细说明。

**Conclusion:** 通过逐步提出的改进方法，尽管部分解决了问题，但如何更有效地实现人类推理逻辑在模型中的掌握仍是未来研究的方向之一。

**Abstract:** Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

**Motivation:** 动机在于提高视频总结技术的有效性，尤其是在处理短视频内容时，捕捉全局时间依赖关系，并保持语义连贯性，同时减少多通道特征融合中的噪声影响。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种名为Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG)的网络，通过结合Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)和动态聚合图推理器来改进视频总结技术。使用SNN设计关键帧提取器，利用SNN的事件驱动计算机制自主学习关键帧特征。同时，提出变分推理重构模块，通过后验分布正则化来减少多通道特征融合中的不确定性问题。

**Result:** 实验证明，Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG)在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，如SumMe、TVSum、VideoXum和QFVS等。

**Conclusion:** SpiVG有效地改善了视频内容的关键信息提取，特别是在优化多通道特征融合不确定性及保持语义连贯性方面表现出色。

**Abstract:** With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes

**Motivation:** 尽管MAE作为一种强大的预训练技术在视觉基础模型中显示出效果，但应用于新数据集时需要大量的超参数调整。当前理论分析较少介入MAE超参数与下游任务表现之间的联系，此研究填补了这一空白。

**Method:** 本研究通过解析推导线性MAE学习到的特征，探讨了遮罩比例(patch size)和图像块大小(masking ratio)如何用于选择捕捉短程和远程空间相关性的特征。进一步，该研究扩展分析至非线性MAE，展示MAE表示如何适应数据集中的空间相关性，超越了二阶统计。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，通过遮罩比例和图像块大小的选择，可以针对性地捕捉不同范围的空间相关性，从而优化MAE在下游任务中的表现。

**Conclusion:** 该研究提供了关于如何在实践中选择MAE超参数的重要见解，包括遮罩比例、图像块大小等，为MAE的优化使用提供了理论基础。

**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

*Dengyan Luo,Yanping Xiang,Hu Wang,Luping Ji. Shuai Li,Mao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

> A new method (BIRD) is proposed for moving infrared small target detection, which outperforms existing methods by jointly optimizing the entire video clip with consideration of both local and global temporal information, resulting in state-of-the-art performance and fast inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation of this paper is to improve the performance of existing learning-based multi-frame methods for moving infrared small target detection by considering joint optimization of the entire video clip and utilizing both local and global temporal information, rather than the conventional sliding window approach which only considers adjacent frames.

**Method:** The paper proposes a Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small target Detection, dubbed BIRD. It includes a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module and a Global Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module to model both local and global spatio-temporal dependencies, and the entire video clip is jointly optimized by a traditional detection loss and an additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) loss.

**Result:** Experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method achieves state-of-the-art performance and has a fast inference speed.

**Conclusion:** The proposed BIRD method shows significant improvement in moving infrared small target detection by considering both local and global spatio-temporal information, leading to better performance and efficiency.

**Abstract:** Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of manual, time-consuming, and unreliable traditional methods for detecting tiny surface imperfections on car exteriors.

**Method:** Creation of a custom dataset with annotated images of car surfaces under varying conditions and training of YOLOv8m-t42 using real-time data augmentation techniques.

**Result:** YOLOv8m-t42 achieved a precision of 0.86, recall of 0.84, F1-score of 0.85, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, with a superior PR curve area of 0.88 compared to the YOLOv8m-t4 model.

**Conclusion:** The YOLOv8m-t42 model demonstrates superior performance in detecting microscopic surface defects compared to the YOLOv8m-t4 model, making it a more practical solution despite its slower convergence.

**Abstract:** Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

*Yogesh Kumar,Uday Agarwal,Manish Gupta,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

> MATR, using a transformer-based method, succeeds in improving the performance of video-to-video moment retrieval, achieving notable gains across two datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the challenges in localizing unseen moments in videos, such as semantic frame-level alignment and modeling complex dependencies between videos, by developing a more effective model.

**Method:** Video-to-video moment retrieval involves finding moments in a target video using a query video. MATR, a transformer-based model, aligns query and target videos by capturing semantic and temporal details to localize moments accurately. It uses dual-stage sequence alignment and a self-supervised pre-training method to initialize the model.

**Result:** MATR demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving gains of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU on ActivityNet-VRL, and 14.7% in R@1 and 14.4% in mIoU on the new SportsMoments dataset.

**Conclusion:** MATR, equipped with a novel alignment technique and self-supervised pre-training, outperforms existing approaches in video-to-video moment retrieval, marking a step forward in this area of research.

**Abstract:** Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

> The paper introduces an SfM-free 3D Gaussian Splatting method for accurate 3D scene reconstruction and image synthesis from sparse inputs, outperforming traditional approaches with a 2.75dB PSNR improvement and superior visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper aims to address the limitation of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in real-world settings where dense multi-view inputs with known camera poses are rare. It seeks to enable accurate 3D scene reconstruction and high-quality novel view synthesis using sparse view inputs.

**Method:** The paper proposes a novel SfM-free 3D Gaussian Splatting method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs 3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. It utilizes a dense stereo module to estimate camera poses and initializes with a global dense point cloud. Additionally, it uses coherent view interpolation, multi-scale Laplacian, and adaptive spatial-aware geometry regularization techniques to improve the quality of geometric structures and rendered content.

**Result:** The method outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches, demonstrating a 2.75dB improvement in PSNR with extremely sparse inputs (using only 2 training views). It produces synthesized images with minimal distortion and rich high-frequency details.

**Conclusion:** The proposed SfM-free approach improves the real-world applicability of 3D Gaussian Splatting by providing a robust solution for 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis from sparse inputs. The technique shows significant improvements in both quantitative metrics (PSNR) and qualitative assessment (visual quality).

**Abstract:** 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the limitation of existing lightweight models in medical image segmentation by balancing efficiency and high performance while ensuring broad applicability, especially in resource-constrained settings.

**Method:** The method involves a novel framework termed LGMSNet that uses heterogeneous intra-layer kernels and sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to optimize feature extraction and global contextual perception, while reducing channel redundancy.

**Result:** The result is a model that excels in segmentation tasks across six public datasets and performs exceptionally in zero-shot generalization tests on four unseen datasets, showcasing its potential for wide clinical application.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that LGMSNet provides a promising solution for efficient and effective medical image segmentation, with promising generalization and applicability in diverse clinical settings.

**Abstract:** Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

**Motivation:** 研究动机在于改进从多视角图像重建3D人体模型的准确性，特别是提高几何结构和身体姿态的估算精度。

**Method:** MExECON 是一种从稀疏多视角RGB图像中重建穿衣人体模型的新流程。该流程基于单一视角方法ECON进行扩展，利用多个视角提高几何结构和身体姿态的估计。核心算法是提出的多视角联合人体优化（JMBO），该算法在同一时间对所有输入视图中的单个SMPL-X身体模型进行拟合，强制执行多视角一致性。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，MExECON相比单一视角基线方法一致性地提高了精度，并且达到了与现代的少量样本三维重建方法相当的性能。

**Conclusion:** MExECON通过多视角联合人体优化算法在不进行网络重训的情况下提升了3D人体模型的重建质量和准确性。

**Abstract:** This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome challenges in multimodal image fusion like modality misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations, leading to improved image quality and downstream applications.

**Method:** AdaSFFuse incorporates AdaWAT for separating high- and low-frequency components and Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for efficient fusion, enhancing adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.

**Result:** Experiments on IVF, MFF, MEF, and MIF show AdaSFFuse's superior performance with low computational cost and a compact network.

**Conclusion:** AdaSFFuse provides a robust solution for improved multimodal image fusion, striking a balance between performance and efficiency.

**Abstract:** Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 合成从记录的驾驶日志中提取的视图对于模拟自主驾驶车辆的驾驶场景至关重要，然而这仍然是一个挑战性任务。最近的方法利用生成先验作为伪地面实况，但通常会导致几何一致性差和过度平滑的渲染。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种名为ExtraGS的全面框架，用于轨迹外推，该框架结合了几何和生成先验。其核心是一个基于混合高斯符号距离函数设计的新型道路表面高斯（RSG）表示方法，以及使用可学习缩放因子来有效处理远距离对象的远场高斯（FFG）。此外，我们还开发了一种基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架，该框架能够选择性地在出现外推伪影的位置集成生成先验。

**Result:** 在多个数据集、各种多摄像机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著增强了外推视图的现实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持了高保真度。

**Conclusion:** ExtraGS框架通过整合几何和生成先验，显著提高了轨迹外推的质量，不仅提高了现实性，也增强了几何一致性。

**Abstract:** Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

**Motivation:** 现有的方法在处理多对象交互和复杂动作的情况下表现不佳，要么局限于单一对象的情况，要么在时间一致性方面存在不足，并且泛化能力较差。为了解决这些问题，提出了GroupSketch方法。

**Method:** 该方法采用两阶段管道，包括Motion Initialization和Motion Refinement。第一阶段，输入草图被交互地划分为语义组，并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画。第二阶段提出了基于组的位移网络（GDN），通过预测组特定的位移场进行粗略动画的细化，利用文本到视频模型的先验知识，并且包含了上下文条件特征增强（CCFE）模块来提高时间一致性。

**Result:** 大量的实验表明，该方法在生成复杂多对象草图的高质量、时间一致性动画方面，显著优于现有方法。

**Conclusion:** 因此，该方法扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围。

**Abstract:** We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

**Motivation:** To efficiently extract narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery, which are limited in width, fragmented topologically, and often occluded.

**Method:** D3FNet, a Dilated Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network, is introduced which incorporates a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module, a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM), and a multi-scale dilation strategy.

**Result:** Experiments on DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks demonstrate superior performance in IoU and recall for narrow and challenging road segments.

**Conclusion:** D3FNet demonstrates robustness in fine-grained narrow road extraction, improving prediction accuracy in complex scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenges in existing TTA methods including scalability issues due to backpropagation reliance, lack of explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions, and the need for source data or supervision at test time.

**Method:** ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method, reframes TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix for closed-form, training-free inference. Lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank corrects potential likelihood biases.

**Result:** Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that ADAPT achieves state-of-the-art performance under various distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness, requiring no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data.

**Conclusion:** ADAPT provides a solution that enhances scalability and robustness for real-time scenarios by supplying a training-free, lightweight regularized approach to TTA without the need for source data or full access to target data.

**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

**Motivation:** 动机在于解决神经网络谱偏置问题，该问题是神经网络倾向于捕获低频成分，难以捕捉高频细节如锐边和细纹理。

**Method:** 具体方法是采用两阶段训练策略。首先使用一个邻居感知软掩码，该掩码自适应地对具有强局部变化区域的像素分配更高的权重，以鼓励模型早期关注细节。然后模型过渡到全图训练。

**Result:** 实验证明该方法能提高图像重建质量，并且与现有的隐式神经表示方法相辅相成。

**Conclusion:** 工作展示了通过根据频率分配像素重要性的创新途径来减轻谱偏置问题。

**Abstract:** Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

**Conclusion:** 本文不仅提供了全局最优性的正式证明，还通过对抗实例的实证结果展现了其全局最优性证明的有效性。

**Abstract:** Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

*Pengcheng Fang,Yuxia Chen,Rui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

> 本论文提出了Grounded VideoDiT，通过三项关键技术改进了视频LLM的时间感知能力和实体对齐效果，在多个基准测试中取得了领先的成绩。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 理解视频不仅需要回答开放式的问题，还需要能够准确指出事件发生的时间和实体如何随时间相互作用。尽管最近的视频LLM在整体推理方面取得了显著进展，但它们在时间感知方面仍然存在粗糙的问题，例如时间戳只是隐式编码，帧级别的特征在捕捉连续性方面较弱，语言-视觉对齐经常偏离感兴趣的实体。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为Grounded VideoDiT的视频LLM，该模型通过引入三项关键技术来解决现有问题：1. 扩散时间潜层（DTL）编码器增强了边界敏感性和保持时间一致性；2. 对象绑定表示将查询实体与局部视觉证据显式绑定，加强了对齐；3. 混合标记方案结合离散时间标记，提供了显式的时间戳建模，实现了细粒度的时间推理。

**Result:** 该模型拥有强大的地面能力，并在Charades STA、NExT GQA以及多个VideoQA基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

**Conclusion:** 通过采用DTL编码器、对象绑定表示以及混合标记方案，Grounded VideoDiT在时间感知和实体对齐方面取得了显著进步，展示了在视频理解任务中的优势。

**Abstract:** Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决因传感器分辨率、植被状态和地形特征等导致的树木实例分割数据变化，以及获取精确标注训练数据成本高昂的问题。

**Method:** 使用人类操作员对初步分割结果进行质量评估，并利用评估过程中产生的标签来训练一个评级模型，进一步微调分割模型。

**Result:** 提出的分割方法提高了34%正确识别的树木实例的数量，并显著减少了非树木实例的预测。

**Conclusion:** 该方法在复杂环境或稀疏森林区域中矮树（高度小于两米）的分割上仍面临挑战。

**Abstract:** Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

*Shuchao Pang,Zhenghan Chen,Shen Zhang,Liming Lu,Siyuan Liang,Anan Du,Yongbin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

> The paper proposes a novel black-box adversarial attack method, CFG, for 3D point cloud classification models, which is effective across different neural network architectures without requiring any information about the target model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to create a more realistic and practical adversarial attack method that works in scenarios where there is no prior knowledge of the target model, improving on existing 3D adversarial attack methods which often require extra information about the model.

**Method:** Previous methods for generating adversarial 3D point clouds often require some information about the target model, but CFG is a novel transfer-based black-box attack method that prioritizes the corruption of critical features without needing to know the target model details. It achieves this by regularizing the generation of adversarial examples according to the importance of features extracted from 3D point clouds.

**Result:** Experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets show that CFG outperforms other state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods in generating imperceptible adversarial examples that are effective across various DNN architectures.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that the CFG method effectively enhances the transferability of adversarial point clouds by focusing on the critical features common across different DNN architectures, performing better than existing methods without needing any knowledge of the target models.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

**Motivation:** 解决现有方法依赖过时离线地图和多模态传感设备带来的计算开销问题，提出一种高效、低成本、以视觉为中心的学生模型方案。

**Method:** 使用了知识蒸馏策略，提出了MapKD框架，该框架包含教师模型、教练模型和学生模型，以实现高效的跨模态知识转移，并引入了TGPD和MSRD两种知识蒸馏策略。

**Conclusion:** MapKD在提高模型性能的同时，减少了计算开销，验证了通过知识蒸馏实现高效、低成本在线HD地图构建的方法的有效性。

**Abstract:** Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

> This paper proposes CM2LoD3, a novel method to automatically generate detailed LoD3 models, especially regarding the reconstruction of building facade openings, thanks to Conflict Maps (CMs) and their semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this research is to solve the challenge of generating detailed LoD3 building models, which are important for urban planning and disaster management, but have traditionally been costly to create due to the need for manual modeling.

**Method:** In this paper, the authors introduce CM2LoD3, a new method for generating Level of Detail 3 (LoD3) models which include detailed facade elements using Conflict Maps (CMs). They focus on semantically segmenting real-world CMs using synthetically generated CMs from their created Semantic Conflict Map Generator (SCMG).

**Result:** The experimental results indicate a 61% performance improvement when using the CM2LoD3 method with uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures to segment and reconstruct building openings, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes by highlighting the contribution of CM2LoD3 to the field of automatic LoD3 model generation, suggesting a future direction for the scalable and efficient automated production of detailed 3D city models.

**Abstract:** Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

> 研究提出MDPR框架，通过构建多元知识库和动态路由机制来解决VLMs在类别不平衡数据上微调时的偏见问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 针对预训练视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在数据类别不平衡的场景下微调时，容易累积偏见的问题。虽然已有研究引入大规模语言模型（LLMs）来增强VLMs微调，补充语义信息，但仍忽视VLMs预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题。

**Method:** MDPR框架通过构建覆盖五个视觉-语义维度的全面知识库来解决VLMs预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题。在微调过程中，动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别，检索最优提示并平衡细粒度语义，通过logits融合产生稳定预测。

**Result:** 实验中，MDPR在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试集上表现良好。消融研究进一步证实了我们的语义库对尾类别有效，且动态路由机制计算开销极小。

**Conclusion:** MDPR在长尾基准测试集上取得了与当前SOTA模型相当的结果，并且其动态路由机制计算开销很小，证明了MDPR是一个灵活高效的针对类别不平衡增强VLMs微调的方法。

**Abstract:** Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

**Motivation:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

**Motivation:** 现有的生成视频模型在长序列上常常出现结构和运动方面的错误积累，此研究旨在通过新的建模方法来改善这一点。

**Method:** 本文提出了WorldWeaver框架，该框架联合建模RGB帧和感知条件，以解决生成长时间视频时的结构和时序一致性问题。主要通过三种途径优化：1. 同时预测感知条件和颜色信息，提高时序一致性和运动动态；2. 利用对漂移更不敏感的深度线索建立记忆银行，增强长期视觉生成的质量；3. 使用分段噪声调度训练预测组来进一步减少漂移并降低计算成本。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，WorldWeaver在扩散模型和校正流模型上都能有效减少时序漂移并提升生成视频的真实度。

**Conclusion:** WorldWeaver框架通过联合建模RGB帧和感知条件，并利用深度线索来优化长视频生成，有效地提高了生成视频的质量。

**Abstract:** Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

**Motivation:** 当前的视觉基础模型在细粒度语义分割方面存在挑战，例如识别特定的核亚型或特定的细胞。本文旨在通过结合分子增强学习和视觉基础模型的优势，改善这些挑战。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种分子增强的All-in-SAM模型，以改进计算病理学。该模型采用全栈方法，包括利用分子增强学习减少详细像素级注释的需求、通过SAM适配器强调特定语义来适应SAM模型，以及通过集成分子导向矫正学习（MOCL）来提高分割精度。

**Conclusion:** 本文的方法不仅减少了注释者的负担，还扩展了精确的生物医学图像分析在资源有限环境中的可访问性，从而推进了医学诊断和病理图像分析的自动化。

**Abstract:** Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial
Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation for the research is to overcome the limitations of existing human mesh modeling approaches which struggle to represent detailed variations in diverse body poses and shapes. The decoupling of shape and skeleton is aimed at providing more direct control over skeletal elements and better fitting.

**Method:** Parametric body models typically use a linear basis over registered 3D meshes, but struggle with detailed variations. ATLAS, a new model, uses 600k high-resolution scans and decouples the shape and skeleton, allowing for better control over body attributes and more accurate fitting in complex poses.

**Result:** ATLAS model shows superior performance in fitting unseen subjects across diverse poses, demonstrating improved accuracy and flexibility compared to linear models.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that decoupling the shape and skeleton in a parametric body model leads to better representation of humans in varied poses and shapes. This method outperforms existing models both qualitatively and quantitatively.

**Abstract:** Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

**Abstract:** 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

**Abstract:** Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

> 我们提出了一种可扩展的组推断方法，提高多个输出的多样性和质量，通过建模为二次整数指派问题和逐步候选集剪枝实现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的生成模型通常独立采样输出，专注于提高个体样本的质量。然而，在实际应用中，用户往往需要一组图像（例如，每个提示的4-8张图片），独立采样容易导致结果重复，限制了用户的选择，并阻碍了构思探索。

**Method:** 我们的方法将组推断建模为一个二次整数指派问题，其中候选输出被建模为图节点，并从中选择子集来优化样本质量（一元项）和最大化组多样性（二元项）。为了显著提高运行时效率，我们利用中间预测逐步剪枝候选集，使得方法能够扩展到大规模候选集。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，相比独立采样基线及近期推断算法，我们的方法在提高组多样性和质量方面显著有效。

**Conclusion:** 我们的框架在范围广泛的任务上具有广泛适用性，包括文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成，使得生成模型能够将多个输出视为一个连贯的组。

**Abstract:** Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

> CineScale 提出了一种新的推理范式，能够使模型在不进行微调的情况下生成更高分辨率的图像和视频，解决了现有方法在生成高分辨率视觉内容时容易出现低质量重复模式的问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有视觉扩散模型受限于数据和计算资源，通常只在低分辨率上进行训练。这限制了它们生成高质量高分辨率图像或视频的能力。

**Method:** CineScale 旨在解决模型生成高于其训练分辨率的视觉内容时，会因为高频信息累积导致的重复模式生成问题，它针对两种视频生成架构提出了专门变体。

**Result:** 实验验证了CineScale在扩大高分辨率视觉生成能力方面的优越性，包括图像到视频和视频到视频的合成。它无需微调即可实现8k图像生成，并且仅通过少量LoRA微调实现4k视频生成。

**Conclusion:** CineScale显著提高了视觉扩散模型生成高分辨率图像和视频的能力。它不仅在生成高分辨率视觉内容时避免了低质量重复模式的生成，同时也扩大了生成范围，包括图像到视频及视频到视频的合成。

**Abstract:** Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

> 我们提出一个新的外科伤口数据集SurgWound和三阶段学习框架WoundQwen，用于外科伤口的全面诊断，能预测伤口特征、评估感染风险以及生成全面的报告，最终目标是改善患者护理和结果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 外科伤口感染是最常见和最昂贵的医疗相关感染之一，当前没有公开的数据集或基准能涵盖各种类型的外科伤口，缺乏开源的外科伤口筛查工具。为解决这个问题，我们提出了新方法和数据集。

**Method:** 我们提出了一个三阶段学习框架WoundQwen，用于外科伤口诊断。第一阶段，采用五个独立的多模态大型语言模型(MLLMs)来准确预测特定的外科伤口特征。第二阶段，这些预测结果作为额外知识输入到两个MLLMs中，负责诊断结果，评估感染风险并指导后续干预。第三阶段，训练一个MLLM，综合来自前两个阶段的诊断结果，生成全面的报告。

**Result:** 通过引入SurgWound数据集和提出WoundQwen框架，为个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者结果铺平了道路。

**Conclusion:** 新技术框架WoundQwen，能够详细分析外科伤口特征并根据外科图像为患者提供后续指导，有潜力改善患者的个人护理和最终康复结果。

**Abstract:** Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.
