To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first\nmethod capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in\nreal-time.

VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration\naccuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It\nensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and\nprovides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a\ncrucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,\nVPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms\nrather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid\ngeneration approach, referred to as \\emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which\nconstructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.\nThese VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations\nessential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more\naccurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed\napproach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain\nscans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for\n35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of\nthe computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the\ncomputed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse\nmap.
