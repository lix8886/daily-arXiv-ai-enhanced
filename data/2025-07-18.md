> 探讨了人类在面对新颖情况时如何整合相关信息进行推理，提出了一种结合分布式和符号表示的计算模型，以仿真人脑在新情境下的推理能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 探讨人类如何整合全局相关信息并在新情境中连贯推理的假设。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为'模型合成架构'（MSA）的计算实现，使用语言模型来实现全局相关检索和模型合成，并用概率程序来实现定制、连贯的世界模型。

**Result:** 在评估时，MSA方法在针对新推理数据集的人类判断方面比仅使用语言模型的基线方法表现更好。

**Conclusion:** MSA方法能更好地反映人类在开放领域中的推理能力，为理解和复制人类在开放领域的推理提供了途径。

**Abstract:** When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

> 研究识别了语言模型中的模态差异向量，证明这些模型的模态分类能力比先前报告的更加可靠，并且这种能力可以用来模仿人类的细粒度分类行为。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管现有研究表明语言模型在模态分类任务上存在挑战，但本研究旨在揭示这些模型可能比先前报告更可靠地分类模态信息。

**Method:** 本研究通过识别语言模型（LMs）中区分模式类别的线性表示——模态差异向量，来分析语言模型的模态分类能力。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，模态差异向量随着模型能力的提升（通过训练步骤、层数和参数数量增加）以一致的顺序出现，而且这些向量可以用来模仿人类对模态的细粒度分类行为。

**Conclusion:** 通过机制解释的技术，本研究为理解和评估语言模型的模态分类能力提供了新的视角，并有潜力增进对人类如何区分模态类别的理解。

**Abstract:** Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

parallel words, phrases and sentences corpora and multilingual sentence encoder
adapted to the Chechen language.

*Arthur J. Funnell,Panayiotis Petousis,Fabrice Harel-Canada,Ruby Romero,Alex A. T. Bui,Adam Koncsol,Hritika Chaturvedi,Chelsea Shover,David Goodman-Meza*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本篇论文提出利用自然语言处理(NLP)技术对死亡报告中的药物相关信息进行自动分类，以提高药物过量死亡的监测效率。实验表明，经过微调的BioClinicalBERT模型在内部测试和外部验证中均表现优异，能有效克服传统ICD-10编码的速度慢和信息丢失问题，并及时检测药物滥用趋势。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 在美利坚合众国，由于芬太尼等药物的流行导致药物相关死亡率上升。传统的ICD-10编码方式在处理自由文本的验尸报告时，存在数据延时和信息丢失问题，因此需要一种更准确、快速的方法来监测药物过量死亡事件。

**Method:** 研究使用了包含35,433个2020年死亡记录的数据集进行模型训练和内部测试，并使用3,335个2023-2024年的独立数据集进行外部验证。评估了多种NLP分类方法，包括单标签和多标签分类器、BioClinicalBERT和Llama 3等微调语言模型。

**Result:** 微调后的BioClinicalBERT在内部测试中获得了接近满分的宏观F1分数，并在外部验证中也表现出色，F1得分为0.966，优于传统机器学习方法和其他语言模型。

**Conclusion:** NLP方法，尤其是微调的临床模型如BioClinicalBERT，可以为从自由文本报告中分类药物过量死亡提供一个高效精确的解决方案，显著提升监测工作的效率。

**Abstract:** The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

### [5] [AdaptiSent: Context-Aware Adaptive Attention for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12695)
*S M Rafiuddin,Sadia Kamal,Mohammed Rakib,Arunkumar Bagavathi,Atriya Sen*

Main category: cs.CL

> AdaptiSent 是一个用于多模态基于方面的 sentiment 分析的新框架，采用自适应跨模态注意力机制，以提高从文本和图像中的 sentiment 分类和方面术语提取能力。在标准 Twitter 数据集上的实验证明 AdaptiSent 在 precision, recall 和 F1 分数上优于现有模型。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 为了改善多模态数据中的 sentiment 分析和方面术语提取，提出了一个集成了动态模态权重和上下文自适应注意力的新型框架。

**Method:** AdaptiSent 使用自适应跨模态注意力机制，动态调整文本与图像在分析中的权重，以及根据上下文调整注意力的方式，来增强 sentiment 和 aspect 相关信息的提取。

**Result:** AdaptiSent 在多个基准测试中，尤其是标准 Twitter 数据集上，展示了超出传统文本模型和其他多模态方法的性能，在 sentiment 分析和 aspect 项提取的精度、召回率和 F1 分数上都表现出色。

**Conclusion:** AdaptiSent 通过动态调整焦点来提升 sentiment 和 aspect 项提取的深度和准确性，为 MABSA 设立新的标杆。特别是在复杂的多模态信息理解上具有突出的优势。

**Abstract:** We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究通过AudioJudge探索了一种通用的语音评估框架，通过不同提示策略的结合，实现与人类偏好高度相关的语音评估。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究的动机是解决当前语音评估方法面临的难题，即专门系统设计的挑战和自动评估与人类偏好的不一致性问题。

**Method:** 此研究通过系统地探索AudioJudge来解决当前语音评估中的两个主要问题：专门系统的设计需求及难度，以及自动评估方法与人类偏好之间的差。研究探索了不同提示工程策略，并发现音频拼接结合上下文学习能显著提高音频特征检测和人类偏好模拟任务的性能。此外，该研究还引入了一种多方面集成的AudioJudge方法，将语音评估分解为词汇内容、语音质量和副语言特征的专门评估组件。

**Result:** 该方法实现了高达0.91的Spearman相关性，表明它能够很好地与人类偏好系统排名基准相匹配。尽管在有噪音的情况下仍能保持良好的性能，但也存在明显的冗长和位置偏差，这些需要谨慎处理。

**Conclusion:** 研究结论表明，通过使用AudioJudge和多方面集成的评估方法，可以实现更精确和一致的语音评估，虽然有改善的空间，但已经取得了显著的进展。

**Abstract:** Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

*Abraham Toluase Owodunni,Orevaoghene Ahia,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究通过FLEXITOKENS方法解决了语言模型适应新数据分布过程中标记器固有的不灵活性问题，性能提升了10%。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 语言模型通过简单的微调难以适应新的数据分布，这是由于其子词标记器的僵化，这导致在外域、未见语言或脚本上的标记分割效率低下。

**Method:** 提出了一种名为FLEXITOKENS的方法，该方法用一个简化的训练目标替代了现有的边界预测器训练目标，从而在适应过程中提供了更大的灵活性。这种方法可以在输入字节序列上学习预测边界，并将其编码成变长的片段。

**Result:** 在多语言基准测试、形态多样任务和不同领域上的评估结果显示，FLEXITOKENS显著减少了标记过碎片化，并在下游任务性能上实现了高达10%的改进。

**Conclusion:** 相较于子词标记器和基于梯度的其他标记器，FLEXITOKENS在跨多种任务和领域中展示了其优势，显著降低了标记过碎片化，提升了10%的下游任务性能。该方法通过更为灵活的训练目标提升标记分割的适应性。

**Abstract:** Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we
develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.
Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and
data for our experiments will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 我们的目标是开发一个能够提供详细评分并确定最佳翻译的系统，并通过评估表明我们的系统与人类评分者高度一致，同时我们也注意到翻译排序系统对呈现顺序的敏感性，并提出了一些方法来应对这种位置偏差。

**Method:** 我们介绍了一种基于提示的翻译评估和排序系统TransEvalnia，该系统使用推理来进行评估和排名，根据Multidimensional Quality Metrics的子集进行细粒度评估，提供每个维度和整体翻译的数值评分。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，TransEvalnia在我们的英语-日语数据以及WMT共享任务中的多种语言对上，表现优于或与当前最先进的MT-Ranker相当。使用Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct作为评估的大规模语言模型，结果显示由Sonnet和其他LLM分配的评分与人工评分相关性良好。

**Conclusion:** 我们提出了一种新的翻译质量评估系统，它不仅可以提供详细的得分和解释，还能评估和排名单个翻译的质量，并且它的性能在一系列实验中得到了验证。所有数据和代码均已开放。

**Abstract:** We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the
various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia
performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.
2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from
various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are
presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data,
including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as
code is released.

*Fuya Nakamori,Yin Jou Huang,Fei Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

> A study proposes an adaptive strategy switching method for Werewolf agents, which improves performance by adapting to the game context and is more effective than using fixed strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation for this study is to improve the performance of Werewolf agents, which can't adapt to changing situations with implicit strategies.

**Method:** This research proposes a method for Werewolf agents to switch between different strategies based on the attitudes of other players and the context of conversations.

**Result:** The researchers compared the effectiveness of their adaptive-strategy Werewolf agents with baseline agents that used either implicit or fixed strategies.

**Conclusion:** The proposed adaptive method was found to be more effective than the baseline strategies.

**Abstract:** This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by
switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players
and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using
prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are
implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research,
we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on
the game context and the estimated roles of other players. We compare the
strategy adaptation Werewolf agents with baseline agents using implicit or
fixed strategies and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

> 通过ThinkLogit及其改进的ThinkLogit-DPO方法，证明了通过解码时期调参可以在不需要额外训练的情况下提高大型语言模型的长链推理能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究目的是探究在没有额外训练的情况下，能否激发大型语言模型的长链式推理能力。

**Method:** 通过解码时期的ThinkLogit方法，利用logits算术使用一个小得多的模型作为引导来调整目标大型语言模型，从而实现复杂推理。进一步通过偏好优化训练引导模型，提出ThinkLogit-DPO方案。

**Result:** 实验表明，使用Qwen2.5-32B作为目标模型，由21倍小的R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B模型引导，ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO在四个数学数据集上分别实现了通过率提高26%和29%。此外，它还可通过强化学习将长推理技能转移到大模型中，相对提高了13%的通过率。

**Conclusion:** 该研究提出了一种计算效率高的方法，可以使大型语言模型实现复杂推理，并且不需要额外训练或只需要很少的训练。

**Abstract:** Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

> Synergy is a byte-level language model with a learned routing mechanism, showing advantages over Llama3 and indicating the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, aiming for more robust and flexible pipelines in language modeling.

**Method:** Synergy, a language model using a learned routing mechanism to bridge different levels of abstraction. It is trained as a byte-level language model focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction.

**Result:** The model showed an advantage over Llama3 under the same model scale and training dataset size. The middle part of the model performed better without positional encodings, indicating the emergence of position-independent concepts.

**Conclusion:** Synergy achieves comparable performance to BBPE tokenizers with fewer concept tokens and demonstrates the potential of position-independent concepts in the model’s higher abstraction levels.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

*Thinh Hung Truong,Karin Verspoor,Trevor Cohn,Timothy Baldwin*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种通过对比学习策略微调文本编码器，以增强其对否定表达的理解能力的方法，该方法通过对大型语言模型的数据进行提炼实现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管自回归大型语言模型得到了快速采用，但在需要丰富的上下文表示的文本理解任务中，较小的文本编码器仍然扮演着重要角色。现有方法在捕捉否定语义方面还存在问题，这影响了依赖文本嵌入的各种下游应用。因此需要改进文本编码器对否定的理解能力。

**Method:** 研究采用从大型语言模型中提炼否定和模态数据，并使用标准对比学习策略微调BERT基模型。

**Result:** 通过从大型语言模型中使用多样化的否定和模态表达式提炼数据，本研究提出了一种增强文本编码器否定鲁棒性的策略。采用标准对比学习策略微调了一个基于BERT的强大模型，在保持通用基准测试中的竞争力表现的同时，显著提高了否定理解能力。此外，该方法也可以应用于LLM，从而在否定基准测试上取得更好的性能。

**Conclusion:** 本文提出的方法可以在保持一般基准测试性能的同时，显着提高文本编码器在否定理解方面的性能，并且该方法也适用于大型语言模型。

**Abstract:** Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 探讨大型语言模型（LLM）在隐式建模符号音乐方面的有效性。

**Method:** 通过生成描述音乐流派和风格组合的文本提示来生成符号音乐数据，并通过识别和生成任务评估其效用。我们创建了一个LLM生成的MIDI文件数据集，不依赖显式的音乐训练。然后，我们完全基于这个LLM生成的MIDI数据集训练神经网络，进行流派和风格分类以及旋律补全，将它们的表现与已建立的模型进行基准测试。

**Result:** 结果显示基于LLM生成的MIDI数据的神经网络在流派和风格分类以及旋律补全方面具有一定的性能，这表明LLM能够从文本中推断基础的音乐结构和时间关系。

**Conclusion:** 此项研究揭示了LLM能够隐式编码音乐模式，同时也指出了由于缺乏显式的音乐背景而导致的局限性，为符号音乐的生成能力提供了见解。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 考虑跨语言一致性能够评估跨语言迁移性，维持模型知识的事实性，保持语言模型性能的平等性。

**Method:** 使用了一些可解释性方法来分析模型在跨语言情境中的行为，通过研究跨语言一致性，发现多种语言模型在不同语言家族和语言因素下一致性程度不一，并发现存在跨语言一致性的瓶颈层。

**Result:** 发现代码切换训练和跨语言词对齐目标策略在提升知识一致性方面表现出最为显著的结果。

**Conclusion:** 跨语言一致性在许多情况下并不是自然而然的，但跨语言对齐监督和代码切换训练对多语言性能的提升和跨语言一致性的增强非常重要。

**Abstract:** Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

**Abstract:** Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

**Motivation:** 本文动机是解决IberLEF 2025 PRESTA任务中的问题，找到一种有效的方法通过分析和处理表格来回答关于西班牙语表格的问题。

**Method:** 该论文提出的方法是通过使用LLMs（大语言模型）生成Python代码来过滤和处理表格，从而获取问题的答案。该方法从MRT在Semeval 2025相关任务中的实现进行了优化。整个过程包括多个步骤：分析和理解表格内容、选择有用的列、生成自然语言指令、将这些指令翻译成代码、运行代码、处理潜在的错误或异常。这些步骤使用了开源的LLMs和针对每一步进行优化的精细提示。

**Result:** 采用上述方法，他们在该任务中达到了85%的准确率。

**Conclusion:** 该论文通过提出使用大语言模型生成Python代码的解决方案，成功提高了回答关于表格问题的准确率至85%，标志着这一方法在处理表格任务上的有效性。

**Abstract:** This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

**Motivation:** 组织面临的威胁环境不断变化，推动了对增加网络安全自动化的需求。然而，过程自动化需要输入数据的形式化。

**Method:** 通过论文，我们介绍了一种新的形式化模型，该模型涵盖了攻击的情境描述及其场景，并使用UML类图进行抽象。

**Result:** 论文展示了该模型如何服务于上游攻击分析过程，以及在网络安全培训中用于自动生成攻击脚本的潜在应用。

**Conclusion:** 该模型为两种应用场景提供了贡献，一是攻击分析过程，二是自动生成攻击脚本，从而为网络安全培训提供支持。

**Abstract:** Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

**Motivation:** 对比传统的基于引用的方法，SemCSE旨在通过语义相关的摘要使模型更好地捕捉科学文本的语义内容，而非仅仅反映相似度。

**Method:** 采用对比学习框架，使用LLM生成的科学文章摘要进行训练，语义相关的摘要在嵌入空间中距离较近。

**Result:** 提出了新的评估基准，证明SemCSE能在嵌入空间中更好地分离语义内容，在SciRepEval基准上达到相应模型大小的最优性能。

**Conclusion:** SemCSE的语义聚焦训练方法在科学文本嵌入任务中表现出更高的性能，证明了其能更好地捕捉文本语义。

**Abstract:** We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

**Motivation:** 自我是一个多方面的概念，在语言中有所体现。尽管它在认知科学和现象学等学科中有所描述，但在自然语言处理（NLP）领域仍较少被探索。自我方面的许多方面与心理健康等领域已研究的现象相匹配，需要进行系统性的NLP基于分析。

**Method:** 本提案计划开发一个计算框架来识别文本中的自我方面，将引入自我方面的本体论和标注数据集，并开发及评估判别模型、生成式大语言模型以及基于嵌入的检索方法。

**Result:** 使用这个基础，计划对开发的模型依据可解释性、地面真理依从性、准确性和计算效率四个主要标准进行评估。

**Conclusion:** 表现最优的模型将应用于心理健康和经验现象学的案例研究中。

**Abstract:** This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 理解标注变异性的来源对于开发公平的NLP系统至关重要，尤其是面对如性别歧视检测这类任务，这些任务中的人口统计偏见是一个重要的关注点。

**Method:** 使用广义线性混合模型来定量研究注释者的人口统计特征和文本内容对接注决策的影响。

**Result:** 研究发现，虽然存在统计上显著的影响，但人口统计因素只占观察到的变异性的一小部分（8%），而推文内容是主要因素。指导生成AI（GenAI）模型使用人口统计角色通常并不会提高，反而可能降低其与人类判断的一致性。解释性AI（XAI）技术揭示了影响模型预测的因素主要是和性别歧视相关的、内容特定的词汇，而不是人口统计特征的关联。

**Conclusion:** 强调关注基于内容的解释和强大的注释协议是实现公平的更有保障途径，比模拟角色更可靠。

**Abstract:** Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

**Result:** 研究确认了词汇多样性和长度相关特征是发展指标，但发现发音速率提供的信息较少。跨语言研究发现特定动词和助动词与减少干预需要相关联，显示出不同的语言中存在通用性和特定性的预测因素。

**Conclusion:** 本研究表明了在多语言环境中，词汇多样性和特定动词与助动词的使用是评估儿童口头叙事能力的重要预测因素。

**Abstract:** Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的评估方法仅关注最终输出的正确性，忽略了低效沟通和差的协调性带来的冗余推理和更高的计算成本问题。本文希望通过对内部协作过程的质量进行评估来更全面地评价多智能体系统的性能。

**Method:** 介绍了一种基于图的评估框架GEMMAS，它通过将代理交互建模为有向无环图来分析内部协作过程。提出了两个过程级指标：信息多样性得分（IDS）衡量跨代理消息的语义变化；不必要的路径比率（UPR）量化冗余推理路径。

**Result:** 在五个基准测试上的评估结果表明，即使在准确性上只有2.1%差异的系统中，IDS和UPR的差异也可达12.8%和80%，揭示了内部协作中存在的显著差异。

**Conclusion:** 发现基于结果的评估指标不足以评估多智能体的性能，强调了设计更可解释和资源高效的协作型AI系统时，过程级诊断的重要性。

**Abstract:** Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 开发早期儿童的叙事和理解技能对于后期的读写能力至关重要，但在大型学前教育班级中，教师难以准确识别需要干预的学生。这促使作者开发一个可以自动评估语言能力的系统，以帮助教师进行个性化教学。

**Method:** 该系统首先使用自动语音识别技术录入口头叙述，然后利用机器学习评分模型预测学生的叙事和理解分数，具体包括线性模型和大型语言模型（LLM）。

**Result:** 实验证明，基于LLM的系统在大多数情况下优于线性模型，尽管后者由于其简洁性也能达到不错的表现。LLM系统在标识需要特别关注的学生时几乎达到了和人类专家相同的准确性。

**Conclusion:** 系统不仅展示了在Afrikaans和isiXhosa两种语言中的高效运作，而且为教室内的自动口头评估打下了基础，为学前教育增加额外的教学容量来关注学生的个性化培养提供了可能。

**Abstract:** Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for
automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and
isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine
learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For
scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language
model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,
but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based
system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require
intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in
classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for
children's learning.

**Motivation:** 当前，大型语言模型在处理未见过的任务，尤其是在数据稀缺场景下，表现不佳。虽然跨任务的上下文学习提供了一种解决方案，但在鲁棒性、可扩展性和效率方面仍存在挑战。本文旨在探索是否可以通过潜在空间导向实现跨任务迁移，避免参数更新和输入扩展。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种名为CAST的新框架，通过在大型语言模型的潜在空间中操纵激活状态，实现跨任务迁移。首先，从高资源任务中选择具有影响力的多样化样本，然后利用这些样本的对比表示增强激活状态，适应低资源任务。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，该方法在跨领域和跨语言迁移设置中优于竞争基线，证明了其具有更好的可扩展性和更低的计算成本。

**Conclusion:** 研究证明，通过对大型语言模型的潜在空间中的激活状态进行操纵，可以有效实现跨任务迁移，且具有良好的可扩展性和低计算成本。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

**Conclusion:** 该测试集填补了评价大语言模型在印地语推理能力上的资源空白。

**Abstract:** Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in
Hindi.

**Motivation:** 随着多模态大型语言模型的发展，新的安全问题出现，特别是在面对对抗性多模态输入时。出于提高这些模型在推理过程中的安全性的考虑，提出了AutoSteer技术。

**Result:** 实验显示，AutoSteer能够显著减少文字、视觉和跨模态威胁的攻击成功率，同时保持模型的一般能力。

**Conclusion:** AutoSteer作为一个实用、可解释和有效的框架，旨在提高多模态AI系统的安全性。

**Abstract:** Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

**Motivation:** 尽管强化学习（RL）已成为训练大型语言推理模型（LLMs）的关键组成部分，但最近的研究对其在改善多步推理，特别是在难题上的有效性提出了质疑。为了应对这一挑战，作者提出了新的策略。

**Result:** 在数学推理任务上，QuestA方法不仅提高了通过率（pass@1和pass@k），尤其在标准RL难以取得进展的问题上，还使得DeepScaleR和OpenMath Nemotron等开源模型的推理能力得到持续提升。在使用1.5B参数模型时，我们取得了新的SOTA结果，在AIME24上达到67.1% (+5.3%)，AIME25上达到59.5% (+10.0%)，以及HMMT25上达到35.5% (+4.0%)。

**Conclusion:** QuestA提供了提高推理能力的实用且可推广的方法，通过提供理论解释，说明该方法能提升样本效率。

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

> TalentCLEF 2025 initiates the first evaluation campaign for skill and job title intelligence, including multilingual job title matching and skill prediction tasks, using real-world data to promote robust and fair models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The paper addresses the need for reliable and fair models in talent acquisition, upskilling, and workforce planning by creating a public benchmark for evaluating systems related to skill and job title intelligence.

**Method:** Task A focuses on Multilingual Job Title Matching, and Task B on Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, using real, anonymized, and manually annotated job application data. Systems use multilingual encoder-based models with contrastive learning for fine-tuning.

**Result:** TalentCLEF 2025 attracted 76 registered teams with 280+ submissions. Training strategies had a greater impact than model size alone.

**Conclusion:** TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark, promoting robust, fair, and transferable language technologies for the labor market.

**Abstract:** Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The

> 本文提出了RCPS框架，通过深度结构叙事规划、自适应布局生成和迭代优化循环解决了自动生成高质量媒体展示中的挑战，并提出了PREVAL评估框架来评价展示质量。实验表明，RCPS在各方面质量维度上显著超越了基线方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有方法在生成演示文稿时往往存在逻辑不一致和布局次优的问题，不能达到专业标准。因此，需要开发新的技术来解决这些问题。

**Method:** RCPS框架包括深度结构叙事规划，自适应布局生成以及迭代优化循环三个关键组件。另外，提出了PREVAL评估框架，通过基于偏好的多维度模型来评估演示文稿的内容、连贯性和设计质量。

**Result:** 实验结果显示RCPS在所有质量维度上都显著优于基线方法，生成的演示文稿接近人类专家的标准，PREVAL评估框架与人类判断高度相关。

**Conclusion:** RCPS能够在高质量媒体生成方面超越现有技术，而PREVAL是一个可靠的自动化工具，用于评估演示文稿的质量。

**Abstract:** Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated
tool for assessing presentation quality.

**Motivation:** 动机在于评估当前语言模型在设计消融研究时的能力，并发现这些模型与人类专家在消融研究设计的准确性、忠实性和合理性方面的差距。同时，旨在探索当前自动化评估方法在任务上的不可靠性，并为未来研究开发更有效的基于语言模型的评估系统提供见解。

**Method:** 介绍了一个名为AbGen的新基准，用于评估语言模型在设计科学研究中的消融研究方面的能力。AbGen包含1,500个从807篇自然语言处理论文中提取的专家注释示例。在这个基准测试中，语言模型需要根据给定的研究背景设计特定模块或过程的详细消融研究。

**Result:** 评估了领先的大型语言模型，如DeepSeek-R1-0528和o4-mini，结果显示这些模型在设计消融研究方面与人类专家之间存在显著差距。同时，当前的自动化评估方法在衡量模型性能上与人类评估之间存在显著差异。

**Conclusion:** 开发了AbGen-Eval，一个用于评估自动化评估系统可靠性的元评估基准。通过对不同语模型作为评判者的系统在AbGen-Eval上的研究，为未来开发更有效的基于语言模型的评估系统提供了见解。

**Abstract:** We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

**Motivation:** 为了改善用户的触觉体验和使触觉信号更好地传达有意义的信息，研究人员构建了一个新的数据集HapticCap，旨在解决当前缺乏大量含文本描述的触觉振动数据集以及现有任务和模型难以描述振动信号的问题。

**Method:** 研究中创建了名为HapticCap的触觉-文本对数据集，包括92,070条人工标注的数据条目。提出了触觉描述检索任务并使用了监督对比学习框架，结合了语言模型T5和音频模型AST来描述振动信号的文本内容。

**Result:** 本研究通过引入一个结合用户描述与触觉信号匹配的多模态数据集和任务，解决了触觉信号设计中缺乏有意义含义的挑战。提出了HapticCap数据集，它是首个完全由人工标注的触觉描述数据集，包含92,070对触觉和文本配对。基于该数据集，提出了触觉描述检索任务，并展示了通过监督对比学习框架获得的性能结果。结合语言模型T5和音频模型AST取得了最佳性能，特别是在对每个描述类别单独进行训练时。

**Conclusion:** 该研究成功地创建了首个完全人工标注的多模态数据集HapticCap，用于描述振动信号中的感觉、情感及关联属性。使用结合T5和AST模型的监督对比学习方法，在触觉描述检索任务上取得了最佳效果。这为设计有意义的触觉信号提供了新的数据资源和研究方向。

**Abstract:** Haptic signals, from smartphone vibrations to virtual reality touch feedback,
can effectively convey information and enhance realism, but designing signals
that resonate meaningfully with users is challenging. To facilitate this, we
introduce a multimodal dataset and task, of matching user descriptions to
vibration haptic signals, and highlight two primary challenges: (1) lack of
large haptic vibration datasets annotated with textual descriptions as
collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 动机是研究搜索引擎如何通过内容的偏优先和受意识形态驱动的用户搜索词贡献于搜索结果中的偏见，这是先前研究较少探索的问题。

**Method:** 研究使用了一组政治和社会话题的数据集来分析主要搜索引擎的输出。

**Result:** 发现搜索引擎不仅按照其潜在偏见来优先内容，而且还通过加剧这些偏见来放大特定的叙事，不同搜索引擎在优先来源方面存在显著差异。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，搜索引擎可能在塑造公共认知方面起关键作用，通过强化意识形态的划分，从而加剧信息隔离的整体问题。

**Abstract:** Search engines play a crucial role in shaping public discourse by influencing
how information is accessed and framed. While prior research has extensively
examined various dimensions of search bias -- such as content prioritization,
indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These
results suggest that search engines may play a pivotal role in shaping public
perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, thereby contributing to the
broader issue of information polarization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究的动机是探索视觉-语言训练是否能显著影响语言模型的语义表示，尤其是在概念的税目组织方面。

**Method:** 通过比较仅文本的语言模型（LMs）及其经过视觉-语言（VL）训练的对应模型，作者研究了视觉-语言训练是否能以有意义的方式改变语言模型的语义表示，尤其是税目组织的知识表示方式。

**Result:** VL模型在需要理解概念的分类知识的文本问答任务中通常优于仅文本的模型。但这不是因为模型中的分类知识本身有所增加，而是因为它们在处理包含分类关系概念的问题时表现出了不同的知识代表方式。

**Conclusion:** 视觉-语言训练不显著改变模型中分类知识的实质性内容，但可以改善这些知识在特定任务中的应用。

**Abstract:** Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

**Motivation:** 解决现有数据驱动方法在序列长度泛化方面任务特定且性能有限的问题，提出更通用的解决方案。

**Method:** 提出了一种称为Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL)的方法，通过合成类似图灵机器执行过程的数据来改进大型语言模型的序列长度泛化能力。

**Result:** 在没有额外技巧的情况下，TAIL利用合成数据显著提高了Qwen2.5-7B在各种任务上的序列长度泛化能力和性能，超越了之前的方法和DeepSeek-R1。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果揭示了图灵机器中的关键概念对TAIL的序列长度泛化能力至关重要，从而模型在其注意力层展现了与图灵机器性质一致的读写行为。该工作为未来的LLM从合成数据中学习推理提供了有前景的方向。

**Abstract:** Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

**Conclusion:** 总之，这篇综述性文章提供了一个统一的框架，用于促进研究人员与工程师开展情境感知的AI技术的进一步发展。

**Abstract:** The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

**Motivation:** 由于现有计算幽默研究集中在短双关语笑话上，该研究旨在探讨大规模语言模型解释幽默的能力是否依赖于特定的幽默形式。

**Method:** 该研究通过创建一个包含600个笑话的数据集，这些笑话分为4种类型，包括异形同音异义词和同音异义词双关语、当代互联网幽默和话题笑话。这些笑话需要理解超越常识的世界知识，例如新闻事件和流行文化。使用这个数据集，研究了各种大规模语言模型（LLMs）零样本解释不同类型的笑话的能力，从而找到了该任务的研究空白。

**Result:** 研究结果表明，测试过的各种模型（包括推理模型）都无法可靠地生成所有笑话类型的充分解释，强调了该领域研究的主要集中在过于简单的幽默形式上的局限性。

**Conclusion:** 现有大规模语言模型在解释复杂且依靠世界知识的幽默类型时能力不足，突显了需在人类理解幽默形式等方面进行更多研究的空间。

**Abstract:** Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitation of state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) in spatial reasoning within 3D space and their struggle with simple tasks such as predicting changes in scene perspective after egocentric motion.

**Method:** MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that pairs a vision-language model with a controllable world model based on video diffusion, allowing for improved 3D spatial reasoning without fine-tuning.

**Result:** MindJourney achieves an average performance boost of over 8% on the SAT benchmark, showcasing enhanced robustness in 3D reasoning compared to VLMs alone or those trained through reinforcement learning with test-time inference.

**Conclusion:** Pairing VLMs with a world model for test-time scaling is a simple and effective method to improve the ability of VLMs to reason spatially in 3D environments.

**Abstract:** Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的多模态大语言模型结构和预训练策略面临着优化不稳定和灾难性遗忘的问题。

**Method:** 通过向预训练的语言模型嵌入新的视觉参数空间，采用增量调优方法稳定地从嘈杂数据中学习视觉知识。设计了Mono-InternVL，利用多模态专家混合架构整合一系列视觉专家。为Mono-InternVL开发了内部视觉预训练(EViP)，以逐步学习提高其视觉能力。进一步开发了Mono-InternVL-1.5，配备改进的EViP++，引入额外的视觉注意力专家，并重新组织预训练过程，以降低成本同时保持竞争力。

**Result:** Mono-InternVL在15个基准中，12个的性能优于现有的多模态大型语言模型，比如在OCRBench上相比于Emu3提高了114分。与模块化版本InternVL-1.5相比，Mono-InternVL-1.5拥有相似的多模态性能，以及更高效率的推理速度。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，Mono-InternVL在15个基准测试中的12个上表现优于现有的多模态大语言模型，Mono-InternVL-1.5相较于模块化的InternVL-1.5，在维持类似多模态性能的情况下，将首个token的延迟减少了69%。

**Abstract:** This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究的动机在于确定最优的大规模像素级作物制图流程，通过对多种预处理方法和分类模型的系统性对比实验来揭示最佳实践，旨在为农业领域提供高效且适应性强的作物类型识别解决方案。

**Method:** Crop mapping采用空间数据（主要来自遥感图像）进行作物类型识别和分类。本文首次全面回顾了大规模、像素级别的作物制图流程，包括传统的监督方法和新兴的迁移学习方法。研究系统性地比较了六种广泛采用的卫星图像预处理方法和十一种监督像素级分类模型，评估了不同训练样本数量和变量组合的影响，并确定了适用于不同域偏差级别的最优迁移学习技术。研究在五个不同的农业站点进行了综合评估。Landsat 8作为主要的卫星数据来源，标签则来自CDL可信像素和实地调查。

**Result:** 研究揭示了三大关键观点。首先，精细化间隔预处理与Transformer模型相结合，无论是对于监督还是迁移学习流程，都能提供最优性能。RF在传统的监督学习和直接迁移至相似领域的场景中提供了快速训练和具有竞争力的表现。其次，迁移学习技术提高了工作流程的适应性：UDA对同质作物类别有效，而微调则在多类场景中保持稳健性。最后，流程选择很大程度上依赖于标记样本的数量。足以保证一定数量的标注样本时，监督训练通常提供更准确和鲁棒的结果；而一旦样本量低于某阈值，匹配特定域偏移级别的迁移学习便成为实现作物制图的可行替代方案。

**Conclusion:** 研究结论显示，精细化间隔预处理和Transformer模型通过提供最优性能，展示了其作为最适合作物制图工作的流程之一的潜力；同时RF在监督学习和直接迁移学习中同样表现出色。迁移学习技术在提高工作流程适应性方面起到了重要作用，无论是通过UDA使用相同的作物类型，还是通过微调适应复杂多样的作物场景。根据标记样本的数量选择指定的流程，以此保证无论是大规模标记样本，还是样本量不足的情况下，都能通过合适的监督和迁移学习技术达到最优识别效果。

**Abstract:** Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

**Abstract:** Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical
imaging.

> 本文提出了一种名为MS-DGCNN++的新方法，它是一种分层多尺度融合的动态图卷积网络，能够有效捕捉不同尺度的特征，并在树种分类和标准3D物体识别中显示出更好的准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 该研究的动机在于解决从陆地激光雷达点云中分类树种时遇到的挑战，现有的多尺度动态图卷积网络方法未能捕捉到树结构不同层次之间的语义关系。

**Method:** 本文提出了MS-DGCNN++，这是一种分层多尺度融合动态图卷积网络，它在局部、枝和树冠尺度上提取语义上有意义的特征并进行跨尺度信息传播，与现有的仅采用并行多尺度处理的方法相比，它更能捕捉树木结构的层次之间的语义关系。为此，MS-DGCNN++采用了尺度特性的特征工程，包括为局部尺度使用标准几何特征，为枝尺度使用归一化相对向量，为树冠尺度使用距离信息。

**Result:** 根据实验结果，在STPCTLS和FOR-species20K数据集上，MS-DGCNN++优于包括DGCNN、MS-DGCNN和最先进的模型PPT在内的其他方法，尽管参数较少，复杂度较低。此外，对于标准3D物体识别，MS-DGCNN++在ModelNet40和ModelNet10数据集上的准确性也超过了DGCNN和MS-DGCNN。

**Conclusion:** 由此得出结论，本文所提出的MS-DGCNN++通过其分层方法能够更有效地处理复杂的多尺度结构，在保留竞争力的同时减少了复杂性，适用于资源受限的应用场景，并且不仅限于树种分类，还可以用于标准3D物体识别，证明其可以作为一个多元应用中点云处理的通用解决方案。

**Abstract:** Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/said-ohamouddou/MS-DGCNN2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管动作预测在人体动作识别中已成为一个重要主题，但其在真实体育场景中的应用受限于合适的标注数据集的可用性。为了改进这个问题，作者提出了一个新的点球数据集以填补这一空白。

**Method:** 本文介绍了一个新的手动标注的足球点球数据集，用于根据点球前球员的动作预测射门方向。作者提出了一种深度学习分类器，该分类器结合人体动作识别（HAR）特征嵌入与上下文元数据，对数据集进行基准测试。

**Result:** 作者测试了七个架构系列（MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D）中的二十二种骨干模型，实现了高达63.9%的预测精度（左或右），超过了实际守门员的决策。

**Conclusion:** 这些结果证明了数据集对预测性动作识别的价值，并验证了模型在体育预测任务中的泛化潜力。

**Abstract:** Action anticipation has become a prominent topic in Human Action Recognition
(HAR). However, its application to real-world sports scenarios remains limited
by the availability of suitable annotated datasets. This work presents a novel
dataset of manually annotated soccer penalty kicks to predict shot direction
based on pre-kick player movements. We propose a deep learning classifier to
benchmark this dataset that integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with
contextual metadata. We evaluate twenty-two backbone models across seven
architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D),
achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the
dataset's value for anticipatory action recognition and validate our model's
potential as a generalizable approach for sports-based predictive tasks.

*Sandipan Sarma,Agney Talwarr,Arijit Sur*

Main category: cs.CV

> 本文提出了一种新的HOI检测方法，通过在编码器级别挖掘HOI特定线索和设计新的损失函数，在HICO-DET和V-COCO数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 考虑到现有的HOID方法主要集中在改进解码器以学习纠缠或分离的交互解释，我们主张HOI相关的线索必须在编码器阶段进行预期，以获得更强大的场景解释。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种名为Funnel-HOI的自上而下的框架，先检测图像中的物体（具体概念），然后检测与这些物体相关的动作（抽象概念）。采用了一种新颖的非对称协同注意力机制，利用多模态信息挖掘这些线索，并在编码器级别产生更强的交互表示。另外，设计了一种新的损失函数，考虑了对象-动作的相关性，并更好地调节了误分类的惩罚，以引导交互分类器。

**Result:** 在HICO-DET和V-COCO数据集上进行的全面实验表明，我们的方法在全监督和六个零样本场景中都取得了最先进的性能，对于未见过和稀有的HOI类别分别提高了12.4%和8.4%的性能。

**Conclusion:** 通过设计HOI特定的线索和新颖的损失函数，我们的Funnel-HOI方法在HOI检测任务上取得了显著的改进，尤其是在处理长尾分布问题（如未见过和稀有的HOI类别）上表现优异。

**Abstract:** Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

*Kaihua Chen,Tarasha Khurana,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

> A novel method (CogNVS) for synthesizing novel views in dynamic scenes from monocular video is proposed, which uses 3D scene reconstruction, pixel inpainting, and self-supervised learning, resulting in superior performance compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation for this work is to address the limitations of previous approaches that either require costly optimization during test time or fail to preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner.

**Method:** Our approach involves three main components: 1) Reconstruction of dynamic 3D scene from covisible pixels, 2) Inpainting of hidden pixels using a 2D video diffusion model, and 3) Self-supervised training of the model from 2D videos to enable its zero-shot application to novel videos with test-time fine-tuning.

**Result:** Empirical results show that CogNVS outperforms almost all prior methods in novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes based on monocular videos.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that the proposed method (CogNVS) is a significant improvement over previous techniques for novel-view synthesis in dynamic scenes from monocular videos, especially due to its ability to be self-supervised and applied zero-shot.

**Abstract:** We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 目前的心血管疾病风险分层方法往往不能早期检测到亚临床变化，本研究旨在整合视网膜微血管特征与血清脂质组学特征，以提供早期疾病指示。

**Method:** 研究使用深度学习图像处理技术量化视网膜表型，通过UHPLC ESI HRMS进行血清脂质谱分析，并进行了大规模的相关分析。

**Result:** 研究发现了平均动脉宽度、血管密度与特定脂质亚类（如三酰甘油、二酰甘油和神经酰胺）之间存在强的正相关性，这种关联独立于年龄和性别。

**Conclusion:** 这项研究填补了早期心血管疾病病理理解的空白，并表明这种结合可以作为识别心血管疾病新生物标志物的潜力，有助于提高早期检测和个性化护理。

**Abstract:** Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

**Conclusion:** FORTRESS 作为深度缺陷分割的有力解决方案，在资源受限环境中展现了卓越的表现，同时满足了准确性和计算效率的需求。

**Abstract:** Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained
environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

**Abstract:** We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at

**Abstract:** Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor

smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will

**Result:** The proposed Mamba Snake framework showed superior performance, achieving an average Dice improvement of 3% over state-of-the-art methods across five clinical datasets.

**Conclusion:** The Mamba Snake framework is effective in unified medical image segmentation by enhancing the modeling of inter-organ relationships and contour refinement, particularly in managing complex morphological structures.

**Abstract:** Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

> 本文提出了一种名为“Think-Before-Draw”的框架，通过引入思维链和渐进性引导的去噪策略，解决了情感说话头像生成中关于情感表达自然度的问题，实验中展示了其在MEAD和HDTF上的优越性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 随着多模态大语言模型的发展，情感说话头像生成的研究信号从音频和视频转向了更灵活的文本。然而，现今基于文本的方法依赖于预定义的离散情感标签文本，这简化了实际面部肌肉运动的动态复杂性，导致难以实现自然的情感表达。本研究旨在通过引入新的框架来提高情感说话头像生成的自然度和真实感。

**Method:** 该研究提出了名为“Think-Before-Draw”的框架，用以解决两个关键挑战：(1) 情感的深层次语义解析 - 创新性地引入思维链（CoT），将抽象的情感标签转化为生理学依据的面部肌肉动作描述，使从高级语义到可操作的动作特征的映射成为可能；(2) 微观表情动态的精细化优化 - 受艺术家肖像画创作过程的启发，提出了一种“渐进性引导去噪策略”，利用“全局情感定位-局部肌肉控制”的机制，优化生成视频中的微表情动态。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，本方法在广泛使用的基准测试 MEAD 和 HDTF 上取得了最先进的性能。此外，我们还收集了一组肖像图像来评估模型的零样本生成能力。

**Conclusion:** 该研究表明，通过引入思维链（CoT）和“全局情感定位-局部肌肉控制”的渐进性引导去噪策略，可以有效解决当前基于文本的方法中情感表达自然度的问题，从而提高情感说话头像生成的真实感。

**Abstract:** Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

> The paper introduces a framework for improving traffic accident anticipation in autonomous driving, addressing data scarcity and lack of object-level cues through generative scene augmentation and adaptive temporal reasoning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The primary motivation is to enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous driving systems by overcoming issues related to insufficient high-quality training data and the absence of critical object-level cues in real-world driving scenarios.

**Method:** The paper proposes a dual-faceted approach: a generative scene augmentation method using a world model guided by domain-informed prompts for creating diverse high-resolution driving scenarios and a dynamic prediction model leveraging enhanced graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators to encode spatio-temporal relationships.

**Result:** The results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy and lead time of accident anticipation, validated through extensive experiments on both publicly available and newly released datasets.

**Conclusion:** The research concludes that the combination of scene augmentation and adaptive temporal reasoning offers a robust solution to current data and modeling limitations, advancing safety-critical applications in autonomous driving.

**Abstract:** Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

**Motivation:** 该论文的动机在于开发一种适用于动态海洋环境的自主无人机视觉系统，以实现在复杂条件下对鲨鱼等海洋动物的连续实时跟踪。

**Method:** 本论文提出了一种自主无人机视觉系统，用于在动态海洋环境中对海洋动物（特别是鲨鱼）进行连续实时跟踪。该系统集成了机载计算机、稳定的RGB-D相机以及自定义训练的OSTrack流水线，能够在具有挑战性的照明、遮挡和海况条件下实现视觉识别。重要创新点之一是无人机间切换协议，它能够在无人机之间无缝转移跟踪责任，从而扩大了无人机操作覆盖范围，克服了单无人机电池的限制。

innovation is the inter-UAV handoff protocol, which enables seamless transfer
of tracking responsibilities between drones, extending operational coverage
beyond single-drone battery limitations. Performance is evaluated on a curated
shark dataset of 5,200 frames, achieving a tracking success rate of 81.9\%
during real-time flight control at 100 Hz, and robustness to occlusion,

viability of coordinated UAV operations for extended marine tracking and lay
the groundwork for scalable, autonomous monitoring.

> The paper introduces ATARA and AnyPos to enhance action execution scalability and efficiency in VLA models by adopting a task-agnostic approach with self-supervised data collection and inverse dynamics modeling, achieving significant performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address limitations of VLA models caused by reliance on task-specific human demonstrations, including scalability, cost, and generalization issues. The aim is to develop a more efficient and cost-effective action paradigm.

**Method:** The paper proposes ATARA, a self-supervised framework for task-agnostic data collection, and AnyPos, an inverse dynamics model with unique decoupled and direction-aware components. Additionally, a video-conditioned action validation module is integrated to ensure policy feasibility.

**Result:** The results show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline achieves a 51% improvement in test accuracy and 30-40% higher success rates in various manipulation tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed system.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the proposed task-agnostic action paradigm, specifically ATARA and AnyPos, along with video validation, can significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of VLA models in complex manipulation tasks.

**Abstract:** Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

**Conclusion:** KCR-Transformer是与多种流行和紧凑型Transformer网络兼容的，它能够减少视觉Transformer的FLOPs，在保持或提高预测准确性的前提下降低计算复杂度。

**Abstract:** Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

> The paper presents an outdoor scene understanding dataset named SVM-City and a vision-language model called City-VLM, which improves understanding of large-scale outdoor scenes through multidomain perception and incomplete multimodal learning techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The primary motivation is to overcome the limitations of current large vision-language models that are mainly focused on indoor scenes. This includes the need for handling multimodal data and integrating 2D and 3D information for outdoor scenarios, as well as dealing with data from multiple perspectives and scales.

**Method:** The paper builds a multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset with 420k images and 4.811M point clouds, along with 567k Q&A pairs. To handle incomplete multimodal data, the authors introduce a method based on incomplete multimodal learning, constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space for multimodal fusion.

**Result:** The experimental results show that the proposed City-VLM model performs 18.14% better on average in question-answering tasks compared to existing models when applied to typical outdoor scene understanding tasks.

**Conclusion:** The City-VLM model demonstrates significant advancements in outdoor scene understanding through its innovative approach to multimodal data fusion and handling various data modalities across different scales and perspectives.

**Abstract:** Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

**Conclusion:** DeQA-Doc框架通过创新方法，成功应用于文档质量评估，展示了多模态大语言模型在该领域的潜力。

**Abstract:** Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

**Motivation:** 由于类内样本量不均衡所导致的长尾问题中，预训练模型虽表现出较强的适应潜力，但细化调整时仅关注视觉编码器而忽视了文本编码器中的语义结构，本文旨在解决这一问题。

**Method:** 本文提出Sage方法，通过SG-Adapter将文本模态中的类描述作为语义指导加入到视觉编码器的微调过程中。为解决分布不匹配导致的预测偏差，还提出了一个补偿因子，该补偿因子基于理论分析，能够纠正该问题。

**Conclusion:** Sage通过创新性地结合视觉与文本信息及解决长尾分布带来的预测偏差问题，展现出在长尾场景下的优异效果，并为未来工作提供了新的视角。

**Abstract:** The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The primary motivation is to address the limitations of existing VQA methods which primarily rely on event-centric Q&A pairs and cannot capture the broader context of video content, including essential details such as object types, spatial layouts, and descriptive attributes.

**Method:** FIQ generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, which is used to strengthen the reasoning ability of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. A VQ-CAlign module is also incorporated to improve the adaptability of the downstream tasks.

**Result:** Experiments on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset show that FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods.

**Conclusion:** The proposed FIQ method, by generating Q&A pairs based on richer video descriptions and employing a task-specific alignment module, successfully improves the generalizability and reasoning ability of VQA models, reaching superior performance on the SUTD-TrafficQA benchmark.

**Abstract:** Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To overcome the limitations of existing CIR methods by integrating cross-modal interaction and utilizing comprehensive visual-textual context.

**Method:** MCoT-RE, a training-free zero-shot CIR framework that uses multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to balance explicit modifications and contextual visual cues.

**Result:** Achieves state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, improving Recall@10 by up to 6.24% on FashionIQ and Recall@1 by 8.58% on CIRR.

**Conclusion:** The proposed MCoT-RE effectively improves image retrieval accuracy by balancing modification text and visual information, leading to state-of-the-art performance in training-free CIR.

**Abstract:** Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning

*Jeong-Woo Park,Young-Eun Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

> FAR-Net is a multi-stage framework for composed image retrieval that integrates early and late fusion approaches to improve semantic alignment and robustness, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve upon the limitations of existing composed image retrieval techniques which either focus too much on text and neglect visual context with early fusion, or struggle with fine-grained semantic matching with late fusion.

**Method:** The paper proposes FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework for composed image retrieval. It includes two modules: ESAM for fine-grained semantic alignments via late fusion with cross-attention and ARM for robustness and adaptability through early fusion with uncertainty embeddings.

**Result:** Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets show that FAR-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 2.4% increase in Recall@1 and a 1.04% increase in Recall@50.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion is that FAR-Net provides a robust and scalable approach to composed image retrieval, effectively addressing the shortcomings of current fusion methods.

**Abstract:** Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

**Conclusion:** The work sets a foundation for enhancing small multi-object tracking in UAV scenarios, with potential applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological monitoring.

**Abstract:** Small Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT) is particularly challenging when targets

temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological

**Motivation:** Error

**Method:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores
by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on
widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

We evaluate our proposed models using two benchmark remote sensing image

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 我们的动机是解决现有VLM模型在现实应用中视觉标记过多的问题，特别是在OCR相关任务中性能显著下降的情况下，提出一种能够根据不同样本动态处理不同分辨率图像的技术，以提高模型在所有任务中的准确性和效率。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种新的视觉标记压缩范式，称为VisionThink。它以降采样的图像开始，并智能地决定是否足以解决问题。如果不足够，模型可以输出一个特殊标记来请求更高分辨率的图像。与现有的使用固定剪枝比例或阈值的高效VLM方法不同，VisionThink可以自主决定是否压缩标记。此外，我们采用强化学习（RL），并提出了LLM-as-Judge策略，以成功地将RL应用于一般的视觉问答任务，并设计了一个奖励函数和处罚机制来实现稳定的图像缩放调用比例。

**Result:** 大量实验证明了我们方法在性能、效率和有效性上的优越性，并已经开源代码。

**Conclusion:** VisionThink展示了对精细视觉理解的强大能力，并在简化任务中节省了大量视觉标记。通过智能决定图像分辨率，它提供了一种更加高效和准确的视觉处理方式。

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address CLIP's difficulty in focusing on task-relevant regions across domains, leading to suboptimal performance on unseen domains.

**Method:** SRE (Simulate, Refocus and Ensemble) scheme is proposed to improve CLIP's focus on domain-invariant regions by aligning attention maps. It simulates domain shifts, learns to reduce these shifts by refocusing attention, and enhances performance with ensemble learning.

**Result:** Experimental results on multiple datasets show that SRE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in domain generalization tasks.

**Conclusion:** The proposed SRE method effectively improves CLIP's performance in domain generalization tasks by focusing attention on domain-invariant regions.

**Abstract:** Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

**Motivation:** 现有的远程感应实例分割方法大多被设计用于预测封闭词汇，限制了它们识别新类别或在不同数据集间泛化的性能，降低了其在地球观测场景的适用性。

**Method:** 通过提出名为SCORE的框架解决现有方法对遥感实例分割开放词汇学习的挑战，该框架整合了多粒度场景上下文，包括区域上下文和全局上下文，以增强视觉和文本表示。具体而言，介绍了区域感知集成（RAI）以改善目标区分度，还提出了全局上下文适应（GCA）丰富文本嵌入，使其更具表达性和适应性。

**Conclusion:** 提出的方法在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了它对大规模和真实世界地理空间分析的有效性。

**Abstract:** Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

**Motivation:** 尽管现有方法在处理推理分割任务中已经取得了显著的进展，但它们仍然受到低感知分辨率的限制。通过简单地插值视觉编码器的位置嵌入来提高感知分辨率只能带来轻微的性能提升，同时带来巨大的计算成本。因此，作者提出HRSeg来提高模型在高分辨率图像上的感知能力。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种名为HRSeg的高效模型，解决了现有方法由于低感知分辨率而造成的局限性。HRSeg引入了高分辨率感知（HRP）和高分辨率增强（HRE）两个关键创新。HRP模块通过对高分辨率图像进行裁剪，结合局部和全局特征以获得多粒度质量。HRE模块则通过整合高分辨率图像中的细粒度信息来增强掩码特征，并细化其与文本特征的对齐，从而实现精确的分割。

**Result:** 经过广泛的消融研究验证了HRSeg各个模块的有效性，同时在多个基准数据集上的综合实验展示了HRSeg的优越表现。

**Conclusion:** HRSeg模型通过高分辨率感知和增强技术，有效提高了视觉编码器在高分辨率图像上的感知能力，并在多个数据集中验证了其优越的性能。这表明HRSeg能够在推理分割任务中更精确地进行对象分割。

**Abstract:** The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

**Motivation:** 开发了一种新颖的可穿戴系统NeckSense，用于头部姿态跟踪。该系统基于多通道生物阻抗传感技术，采用了轻量级的项链式设计。目的是既能够提供可靠的头部姿态跟踪性能，又能够满足小型化和不依赖视觉的设备需求。

**Result:** 在7名参与者上验证了NeckSense系统，使用当前最先进的姿态估计模型作为真实值。该系统在各种头部运动中实现了平均每个顶点误差为25.9毫米的结果，证明了这一小巧无视线要求的生物阻抗可穿戴设备能够提供与最先进的视觉方法相当的头部跟踪性能。

**Conclusion:** NeckSense作为一款无视线要求且小巧的生物阻抗可穿戴设备，证明了其能够在不同头部运动中实现头部跟踪，其性能可与先进的视觉方法相媲美。这一系统为未来可穿戴设备的发展提供了新的方向。

**Abstract:** We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that
leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes
embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures
dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** Existing methods for emotion recognition either rely on explicit signals that can be masked, or require complex physiological sensors that limit scalability. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by using unobtrusive visual cues.

**Method:** Proposes a camera-based, user-unaware approach for emotion recognition that uses gaze fixation patterns and environmental semantics with temporal dynamics. It captures eye appearance and head movements using standard HD cameras without specialized hardware.

**Result:** The approach allows for real-time, continuous, and user-unaware emotion recognition with high generalizability and low deployment costs.

**Conclusion:** Integrating gaze patterns, environmental context, and temporal dynamics provides a more accurate and robust way of capturing emotions that reflect human-environment interactions.

**Abstract:** Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

**Motivation:** 现有的车道检测模型在迁移到新的环境时会出现性能下降，而使用真实标签进行性能评估成本较高，因此提出了不依赖真实标签的性能评估方法。

**Method:** 从图像分类中借鉴了五种性能评估方法，并提出了LanePerf框架，将图像和车道特征相结合，使用预训练的图像编码器和DeepSets架构。

**Conclusion:** 研究证明了不依赖地面真实标签的车道检测性能评估的可能性，这将支持更高效的测试和更安全的驾驶环境。

**Abstract:** Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

**Result:** The experiments show that both Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star perform better than existing baseline algorithms on the new dataset designed for Federated Learning.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that their proposed Federated Learning algorithms, Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star, can achieve better performance on their introduced image classification dataset, demonstrating the potential for enhancing the learning effectiveness of Federated Learning scenarios.

**Abstract:** Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 运动捕捉系统成本高昂，而单目3D姿态估计作为体育分析的一种灵活替代方案被提出。然而，其实际应用受到缺乏现实运动数据集以及对于运动任务的可靠性模糊的限制。本研究旨在通过介绍新的数据集来解决这些问题。

**Method:** 介绍了新的公开数据集AthleticsPose，该数据集包含了23名运动员在田径场上进行各种比赛项目的实际动作捕捉。使用该数据集训练了一个代表性的3D姿态估计模型，并进行了全面的评估。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，相较于基于模仿运动数据集训练的基线模型，AthleticsPose数据集训练的模型在MPJPE指标上提升了约75%。此外，模型在估计精度上对相机视角和目标大小敏感，并且在特定的高频指标如膝关节驱动速度上有预测偏差。

**Conclusion:** 该工作为研究界提供了一个有价值的数据集，并阐明了使用单目3D姿态估计进行运动分析的潜力与实践中的局限性。

**Abstract:** Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

> 提出Argus，一种利用多视角图像增强3D场景理解的创新3D多模态框架，旨在解决仅用3D点云处理时的信息损失和细节失真问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 点云重建导致信息损失以及复杂的结构造成细节失真，多视角图像可以提供更详细的场景表示，以弥补这些缺陷。

**Method:** Argus融合多视角图像和摄像头姿态，创建综合和详细的3D感知场景嵌入，处理文本指令、2D多视角图像和3D点云等多种模式输入。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，该方法在多种下游任务上优于现有的3D-LMMs。

**Conclusion:** Argus展示了3D多模态模型的潜力，能更好地利用LMMs来理解和处理3D任务。

**Abstract:** Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 扩散模型虽在图像生成上取得显著成果，但其计算成本高，难以在资源受限的环境中部署。现存的后训练量化方法在面对低比特宽度时，未能充分考虑异常值问题，导致量化后性能下降。

**Method:** 本文提出了DMQ，结合Learned Equivalent Scaling优化通道式的缩放因子，将量化难度在权重和激活之间重新分配；引入自适应时间步权重方案优化早期去噪步骤的学习；提出通道式2的幂缩放，用于如跳层这类高通道间方差层的激活。通过投票算法确保在小规模校准集上可靠选择PTS因子。

**Result:** 实验表明，该方法显著优于现有工作，尤其在W4A6和W4A8等低比特宽度条件下，保持了高质量的图像生成能力和模型稳定性。

**Conclusion:** DMQ在低比特宽度量化中展示了优越的性能和模型稳定性，适用于资源受限环境中的图像生成任务。

**Abstract:** Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

in this paper. The proposed framework presents an effective combination of the
online an offline data augmentation to tackle the imbalanced data, a backbone
EfficientNet\_Large deep learning model for extracting robust embedding

classification performance. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.8938

**Motivation:** 为了降低可见光-红外重识别（ReID）模型对跨模态样本标签的依赖，本论文探索了一种基于仅使用单模态样本身份标签的弱监督跨模态ReID方法。

**Method:** 本论文提出了一种异构专家协作一致性学习框架，用于解决跨模态标签不足的问题。该框架通过利用单模态下的标签独立训练分类专家，并设计跨模态关系融合机制来提高预测精度。

**Result:** 实验结果在两个具有挑战性的数据集上验证了提出方法的有效性。

**Conclusion:** 该方法能显著提升模型提取模态不变特征的能力，改善跨模态身份识别。

**Abstract:** To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

> 研究提出了一种不确定性传播的模型用于捕获多模态大型语言模型输入中的不确定性关系，并展示了这些模型在临床应用中的有效性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）可以处理和整合来自多种模态源的信息，如文本和图像。然而，在大规模MLLMs的背景下，输入模态之间的相互关系、由于单模态数据而导致的不确定性以及这种不确定性分解后的潜在临床应用尚未完全理解。

**Method:** 提出了一种基于不确定性传播的多模态不确定性传播模型（MUPM），该模型描述了图像仅、文本仅和联合图像-文本变化在MLLM输入中的不确定性之间的关系。

**Result:** 使用包含心脏MR扫描和数字医疗记录的真实临床数据，表明MUPMs可以使用少量样本进行有效优化。此外，我们展示了拟合的MUPMs在不同的输入数据分布和，甚至在不同的下游任务中具有泛化能力。这种转移性可能是由于共享了预训练、较为轻量的MLLM微调以及MUPMs固有的低维特性。

**Conclusion:** 本研究展示了一种直接的临床应用，可以稳健地估计和分析差异性数据或甚至全新的心脏疾病预测任务中的不确定性。此外，实验显示了所需多模态数据在估计总体不确定性和冗余因素识别中的效率，都考虑了实际且在临床上有用的MUPMs应用。

**Abstract:** Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

**Motivation:** 鉴于自注意力机制在生成长视频时存在的二次复杂度问题，以及现有方法在时间和扩展性上的缺陷，此研究旨在介绍一种更高效、更具时间连贯性的DiTs扩展方案。

**Method:** 该研究具体采用了FlexFormer自编码器技术，能够灵活处理变长的视频和文本输入，并通过位置感知机制来增强时间上下文的理解，最终在统一框架下实现了多种视频生成任务。

**Result:** 研究通过引入LoViC框架，利用FlexFormer这一自编码器，解决了基于扩散变压器（DiTs）生成长视频时因自注意力机制的二次复杂度而导致的扩展难题。FlexFormer能够将视频和文本压缩为统一的潜在表示形式，支持变长输入和线性调整的压缩率，其核心是基于Q-Former架构设计的单查询令牌。通过位置感知机制编码时间上下文，模型可以在统一范式中支持预测、逆向预测、插值和多镜头生成等多种功能。实验结果证明该方法的有效性和多功能性。

**Conclusion:** LoViC框架通过FlexFormer成功提升了长视频生成的效果和效率，展示了其在文本到视频生成任务中的优越性能和广泛应用潜能。

**Abstract:** Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

**Motivation:** 解决传统学习基础变形图像配准框架中调整正则化参数耗时长，需要多次训练的问题。

**Method:** 引入cIDIR框架，利用隐式神经表示技术，通过在先验分布的正则化超参数上训练，再利用分割掩码优化这些超参数，构建了一个连续可微的变形矢量场。

**Result:** 在DIR-LAB数据集上达到了高准确性和鲁棒性。

**Conclusion:** cIDIR框架相较于传统方法不仅提高了学习效率，还保证了配准结果的准确性与鲁棒性。

**Abstract:** Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

**Motivation:** 先前的方法严重依赖显式的几何先验，这导致在交叉替换和其他微妙情感表现上出现了很多瑕疵，并且对多角色动画的支持不足。FantasyPortrait旨在解决这些挑战。

**Method:** FantasyPortrait, 一种基于扩散转换器的框架，能生成高保真度和丰富情感的动画，适用于单个和多个角色的场景。这种方法引入了增强表达学习策略，利用隐式表示捕捉无身份偏见的面部动态，并设计了屏蔽交叉注意机制以独立且协调地生成表情，避免特征干扰。

**Result:** 通过广泛的实验，FantasyPortrait在定量和定性标准上都明显优于最先进的方法，尤其在跨替换及多角色动画生成上表现出色。

**Conclusion:** 提出的FantasyPortrait框架及其方法显著提高了面部表情动画的质量，特别是解决了多角色和交叉替换的挑战，这项工作为相关领域的研究提供了宝贵的资源，包括新提出的Multi-Expr数据集和ExprBench基准测试。

**Abstract:** Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 手腕病理在儿童中非常常见，但诊断过程耗时且需要专业的知识。计算机视觉是一个有潜力的解决方案，但受限于医学影像数据集的稀缺。此外，仅依赖一种模态（如图像）在如今数据类型丰富的情况下是不够的。

**Method:** 本研究采用多方面方法来解决有限数据集下的手腕病理识别问题。首先，将问题视为细粒度识别任务，旨在识别X光片中细微的病理变化，这些变化是传统的CNN模型可能忽视的。其次，通过结合患者元数据与X光图像来提升网络性能。最后，使用在细粒度数据集上训练的权重代替在如ImageNet等的粗粒度数据集上预训练的权重。

**Result:** 研究结果显示，通过采用细粒度策略和集成患者元数据，诊断准确性在有限的数据集上提高了2%，而在更大聚焦于骨折的数据集上，准确性提高了10%以上。

**Conclusion:** 这项研究表明，通过细粒度识别技术和融合患者元数据的方法，可以在有限的数据集中显著提高手腕病理的诊断准确性。

**Abstract:** Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

<details>

**Motivation:** 光谱重建是图像处理中的一个关键问题，它要求从对应的RGB图像中重建高光谱图像。一个主要的难点在于估计不可观察的特征，这些特征包含了未被RGB成像传感器捕获的重要光谱信息。

**Conclusion:** 通过将不可观察的特征从高光谱图像中分离出来并压缩到紧凑的潜在空间中，该方法能够更有效地学习光谱-空间联合分布。该方法在提出的方法中具有创新性，取得了显著的成绩。

**Abstract:** Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

*Uranik Berisha,Jens Mehnert,Alexandru Paul Condurache*

Main category: cs.CV

> A new structured pruning technique called Variance-Based Pruning for efficient model compression with minimal retraining, demonstrated to be effective on DeiT-Base model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of deploying large models like Vision Transformers due to their high latency, computational costs, and memory requirements, while maintaining performance without extensive retraining.

**Method:** Variance-Based Pruning, a structured one-shot pruning technique that uses activation statistics to select neurons for pruning and integrates mean activations back into the model to retain high performance.

**Result:** On ImageNet-1k, DeiT-Base retains over 70% of original performance immediately after pruning and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99% of its original accuracy, with a 35% reduction in MACs and a 36% reduction in model size, speeding up the model by 1.44x.

**Conclusion:** Variance-Based Pruning effectively compresses networks with minimal fine-tuning, making deployment more feasible, especially for resource-constrained devices.

**Abstract:** Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

> DISSect, a novel sample selection method, uses differential prediction analysis to improve the quality of multimodal model training by dealing with noisy correspondences efficiently.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to address the challenge of training contrastive-learning-based multimodal models efficiently, specifically dealing with the noise in correspondence data during sample selection.

**Method:** The paper introduces DISSect, a method that uses the differential between predicted correlations of current and historical models to characterize sample quality, enabling accurate and efficient discrimination of noisy correspondence for training acceleration.

**Result:** The DISSect method demonstrates consistent superiority over current state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks and benchmark datasets.

**Conclusion:** DISSect effectively accelerates the training process of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models by accurately discriminating noisy correspondence, offering a promising alternative to existing sample selection paradigms.

**Abstract:** The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

**Motivation:** 尽管MAR模型因其并行解码的高效性而受到关注，但与传统的AR模型相比，它们在图像生成质量上表现不佳。本研究旨在通过精进MAR架构来改善这一状况。

**Method:** 研究首先评估了不同的图像标记化方法，然后通过将因果注意力替换为双向注意力并结合2D RoPE改进了Bidirectional LLaMA架构，形成了新的MaskGIL模型。

**Result:** 研究通过改进Masked AutoRegressive (MAR)模型架构，引入改进的Bidirectional LLaMA架构（包括双向注意力和2D RoPE），提出了名为MaskGIL的新模型。MaskGIL在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中的FID评分为3.71，与最先进的AR模型相当，且仅需8个推断步骤，远少于AR模型所需的256个步骤。此外，研究还开发了一种基于文本的MaskGIL模型，可用于从文本生成图像。

**Conclusion:** 该模型不仅在图像生成上表现出色，还扩展了AR基生成的加速能力，并支持实时语音转图像的应用。

**Abstract:** AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient

compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256

775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond

**Motivation:** 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）取得了进展，但它们在适应未见过的复杂宽区域场景方面仍然面临挑战。本文针对这一问题提出了HCS机制。

**Method:** 本文提出了一种层级核心集选择（HCS）机制，旨在推动视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂宽区域场景理解中的适应。HCS通过一个理论保证的重要性函数逐步细化选定的区域，该函数考虑了效用性、代表性、鲁棒性和协同性。

**Conclusion:** HCS作为一种即插即用的方法，与任何VLM兼容，能在不需额外微调的情况下，通过最小化解释性区域实现快速理解复杂场景，并提升多任务性能。

**Abstract:** Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

**Abstract:** Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

**Motivation:** 对于自动驾驶等至关重要的机器人应用来说，准实在时候检测所需的全部对象至关重要。虽然联合使用子网络来估计深度、姿态、光流和场景流的方法提出了运动分割的解决方案，但其总体计算成本高，阻碍了实时性能。本论文旨在通过减少计算需求来提升实时性能。

**Method:** 本论文提出了一种基于成本体的运动特性表示方法——通道式运动特征（Channel-wise Motion Features）。该方法通过提取特征图中每个实例的深度特征并捕获场景的3D运动信息来提高效率。此方法仅依赖姿态网络（Pose Network），而不需其他子网络。

**Result:** 该方法在KITTI数据集和Cityscapes数据集上的性能提升了约4倍每秒帧数（FPS），并且达到了与现有最先进模型相当的准确性，同时将模型参数减少到25%。

**Conclusion:** 本论证实验结果表明该方法在保持准确性的同时大幅度提高了帧率并减少了模型参数，证明了其作为安全关键机器人应用中高效运动分割方案的可行性。

**Abstract:** For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

**Motivation:** 针对之前模型在处理开放世界对象检测任务时存在对象预测和分类预测之间的学习冲突问题。希望在此基础上进一步提高性能。

**Method:** Decoupled PROB提出了一种新的方法来解决OWOD问题，包括早停对象预测（ETOP），它在解码器中的适当层停止对象预测，以及任务解耦查询初始化（TDQI），后者结合了查询选择与可学习查询，有助于更有效地提取已知和未知对象的特征。

**Result:** 在OWOD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，Decoupled PROB在多个指标上优于所有现有方法。

**Conclusion:** Decoupled PROB通过引入ETOP与TDQI，有效解决了PROB模型中的学习冲突问题，提升了OWOD的性能。

**Abstract:** Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

**Motivation:** Error

**Result:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

**Conclusion:** GLAD框架展示了在少样本学习中有效防止过拟合的能力，同时保持了模型在各种泛化任务上的优越性能，证明了其广泛适用性和有效性。

**Abstract:** Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

**Abstract:** Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

**Abstract:** Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

**Motivation:** 高分辨率3D点云因其密集和不规则的性质具有检测工业检测中细微结构异常的潜力，但同时也带来高计算成本、空间对齐敏感性以及捕捉局部结构差异的困难等挑战。本文旨在解决这些问题，提高3D异常检测的精确性和效率。

**Method:** 该论文提出了一种基于配准的异常检测框架，结合多原型对齐和聚类差异分析，以实现精确的3D异常定位。首先，每个测试样本会与多个正常原型进行配准，以便进行直接的结构比较。为了在局部层面评估异常，对点云进行聚类，并计算测试样本和每个聚类中原型特征之间的相似性。聚类中心不是随机选择的，而是采用关键点引导的策略，选择富含几何信息的关键点作为中心。这种方法确保了聚类集中在特征丰富区域，使得距离比较更具意义和稳定性。

**Abstract:** High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

**Abstract:** IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared
blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

### [106] [RS-TinyNet: Stage-wise Feature Fusion Network for Detecting Tiny Objects in Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13120)
*Xiaozheng Jiang,Wei Zhang,Xuerui Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

> 文章提出了RS-TinyNet，一种专门用于遥感小目标检测的多阶段特征融合与增强模型，通过实验验证了其较现有最优检测器有更高的检测精度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 遥感(RS)图像中检测小目标一直是长期的挑战，因为它们的空间信息有限、特征表示弱且在复杂背景中密集分布。尽管许多努力尝试，主流检测器在此场景中仍表现不佳。为了解决这个问题，提出了RS-TinyNet。

**Method:** RS-TinyNet采用了多阶段特征融合与增强模型，特别为遥感小目标检测设计。该模型包括两个新颖的设计：小目标显著性建模和特征完整性重构。模型设计了三个逐步特征增强模块：多维协作注意力(MDCA)模块使用多维注意力增强小目标的显著性，辅助可逆分支(ARB)模块和渐进融合检测头(PFDH)模块用于保留信息流并融合多级特征以弥合语义差距并保留结构细节。

**Result:** 在公开的遥感数据集AI-TOD上的全面实验显示，RS-TinyNet在平均精度(AP)上超过了现有最优检测器4.0%，在AP75上超过了6.5%。此外，DIOR基准数据集上的评估进一步验证了其在各类遥感场景中的卓越检测性能。

**Conclusion:** 这项研究表明，提出的多阶段特征融合策略为复杂遥感环境中的小目标检测提供了一个有效的解决方案。

**Abstract:** Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

**Motivation:** 本研究动机在于利用改进的视觉基础模型（如DINOv2）以提升基于学习的单目视觉里程计在稳健性、泛化能力和效率方面的性能，同时解决其在特征细化方面的挑战。

**Method:** 本文提出了DINO-VO，一种利用DINOv2视觉基础模型进行稀疏特征匹配的基于特征的视觉里程计系统。为了克服特征细化问题，作者设计了一种专门针对DINOv2粗略特征的显著关键点检测器，并补充了稳健语义特征的细粒度几何特征，从而提升了局部化表示能力。此外，基于变换器的特征匹配器与可微分姿态估计层共同实现了精确的相机运动估计。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，DINO-VO在TartanAir和KITTI数据集上比以前的逐帧视觉里程计方法表现更好，并且在EuRoC数据集上具有竞争力。此外，它还能在单个GPU上以小于1GB的内存消耗运行，达到72FPS的性能，说明其实时性和效率。

**Conclusion:** DINO-VO相对于先前的SuperPoint方法等展示了更强的鲁棒性，并且其特征描述符在与独立的DINOv2粗略特征的对比中表现出更高的准确性与泛化能力。DINO-VO在TartanAir和KITTI数据集上优于之前的逐帧视觉里程计方法，并且在EuRoC数据集上具有竞争力，同时能够在单个GPU上以小于1GB的内存消耗运行，达成了72FPS的实时性。DINO-VO在户外驾驶场景中对抗视觉SLAM系统表现出色，证明了其泛化能力。

**Abstract:** Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

> This paper presents SE-VLN, a novel self-evolving framework for VLN that integrates experiential knowledge for enhanced performance, overcoming the static boundaries of large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this paper is to address the limitations of current VLN methods that fail to fully incorporate experiential knowledge due to the fixed nature of LLMs, thus offering limited evolutionary capacity.

**Method:** The paper proposes a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) that includes a hierarchical memory module, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module, and a reflection module to enable the continuous evolution of VLN agents.

**Result:** The SE-VLN framework achieved significant improvements in navigation success rates, reaching 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, compared to 23.9% and 15.0% improvements over state-of-the-art methods on the R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that SE-VLN, with its self-evolving capabilities, demonstrates great potential as a framework for VLN by showcasing performance improvements with an increasing amount of experience, indicating a promising direction in multimodal LLM-powered self-evolution.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

**Conclusion:** 研究证实了连续自回归模型在自动驾驶世界的模型构建中具有显著优势，该模型对单一设计选择的鲁棒性强且表现更佳。

**Abstract:** Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model

**Motivation:** 随着AI生成视觉内容的质量提高，需要一种新方法来检测AI生成的视频，特别是在DeepFakes领域之外的通用视频内容检测方面。

**Method:** 利用预训练视觉模型提取特征来区分真实和生成的视频，并通过简单线性分类层进一步提升性能。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明该方法有效地提高了AI生成视频的检测性能，有望在检测AI生成视频方面做出贡献。

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

> 本研究提出了一种新型全局匹配架构 $S^2M^2$，在实现高效率的同时提高立体匹配的准确性，并且不需要特定数据集的微调。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究的动机在于解决立体匹配模型在不同分辨率和视差范围下进行泛化时存在的挑战。迭代局部搜索方法虽在约束基准上获得高分，但其机制限制了全局一致性。另一方面，虽然全局匹配架构理论上更为稳健，但由于计算和内存成本过高而难以实现。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种名为 $S^2M^2$ 的全局匹配架构，结合了多分辨率变压器和一种新的损失函数，该损失函数将概率集中在可行的匹配上。这种设计使模型能够在不依赖成本体积过滤或深层次优化堆栈的情况下，实现最高的准确性和效率。

**Result:** $S^2M^2$ 在 Middlebury v3 和 ETH3D 基准测试中确立了新的最先进水平，超出先前方法，实现了高质量细节的高效率重建。

**Conclusion:** 通过使用 $S^2M^2$，研究者展示了一种方法论，可以在不诉诸成本高的缩放方法下实现全局一致性和高水平准确性，从而推动了通用立体匹配模型的发展。

**Abstract:** The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

**Motivation:** 目的是开发一种更高效的视觉到行动策略，简化了传统方法中的条件模块并减少了时间和空间的开销，同时解决了不同模态之间匹配的难题。

**Method:** VITA使用视觉信息作为流的来源，构建了一个结构化的动作潜在空间，并通过解码流潜在来监督匹配，以此实现从视觉到行动的转化。

**Result:** 在ALOHA平台上的实验表明，VITA在五个仿真和两个现实世界的任务中表现出色，较传统策略有显著的性能提升和减少的延迟。

**Conclusion:** VITA证明了其作为首个仅用MLP结构实现复杂手工操作任务的能力，并在效率和性能上优于现有策略。

**Abstract:** We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

**Method:** 本论文提出了一种近似正交微调策略(AOFT)，该策略使用一个可学习的向量来生成一组近似正交的向量，这些向量构成了低秩权重的下投影和上投影矩阵，从而使得这些矩阵的性质与骨干网络矩阵相一致。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在一系列下游图像分类任务上取得了具有竞争力的性能，验证了该方法在提高ViT泛化能力方面的有效性。

**Abstract:** A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

**Abstract:** Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion
e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and
lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting
semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we
introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person

same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven
conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment

**Abstract:** The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

**Conclusion:** 该方法为手与物体交互的实时检测提供了一个有效的解决方案。

**Abstract:** Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 扩散变压器（DiT）在视频生成任务中表现优异，但其高计算成本使得其在资源受限的设备上应用不切实际，实现实时生成更是困难重重。本研究旨在通过优化使扩散模型能够实现在移动平台上进行实时、高质量的视频生成。

**Method:** 研究提出了一系列的优化策略来显著加速基于扩散模型的视频生成，使之能够在移动端设备上实现实时视频生成。具体来说，首先使用了一个高压缩的变分自编码器（VAE）以降低输入数据的维度，同时保证视觉质量。其次，引入了一个KD指导下的敏感度感知的三级剪枝策略，以缩小模型尺寸，使其适应移动平台，同时保留关键性能特征。最后，研究开发了一种针对扩散模型的对抗性步骤蒸馏技术，可以将推理步骤减少到四个。

**Conclusion:** 本研究为使基于扩散模型的视频生成在移动设备上实现实时生成提供了可行的技术路径。

**Abstract:** Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number
of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to
achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max,
demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on
mobile devices.

> A sliding iterative denoising method is proposed to improve spatio-temporal consistency in human view synthesis from sparse-view videos, outperforming current 4D diffusion models on key datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation of this paper is to improve the spatio-temporal consistency in human view synthesis from sparse-view videos, as the existing 4D diffusion models often suffer from inconsistent output.

**Method:** Our method involves a sliding iterative denoising process on a latent grid, which encodes images, camera poses, and human poses for generating consistent videos at novel viewpoints.

**Result:** The experiments on DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrated that the proposed method can synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that by incorporating a sliding iterative denoising process, the 4D consistency of output videos is enhanced, leading to a more practical solution with affordable GPU memory usage.

**Abstract:** This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

> A concept-wise equalization loss function, IMBA loss, improves the stability of complex concept handling in visual generation tasks without requiring significant changes to existing setups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation stems from the observed instability and error-proneness in handling complex concepts within visual generation tasks, a less explored area.

**Method:** Our proposed method introduces a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) for stability in responding to and combining complex concepts in visual generation tasks.

**Result:** On a newly proposed benchmark Inert-CompBench and other public test sets, the proposed method significantly improves the baseline models' responsiveness to complex concepts.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that the IMBA loss function can effectively enhance concept response stability with minimal changes, both in terms of code and dataset preprocessing.

**Abstract:** In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex
concepts often lack stability and are error-prone, which remains an
under-explored area. In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors
for poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also
design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this
issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset
processing, and requires minimal code changes. In our newly proposed complex
concept benchmark Inert-CompBench and two other public test sets, our method
significantly enhances the concept response capability of baseline models and
yields highly competitive results with only a few codes.

**Motivation:** 研究的动机是开发一种能够从不同输入形式生成复杂3D对象的方法，以提升3D重构的质量和效率。

**Method:** 该模型使用3DShape2VecSet作为基础，通过自回归方式生成3D对象的各部分，可以使用2D图像、2D掩模或现有3D对象作为输入，逐步生成3D部分直至完成整个对象。

**Result:** 该模型成功展示了其在3D对象部分生成上的高质量，达成了该领域的最先进性能。

**Conclusion:** AutoPartGen模型通过创新的自回归生成方法，能够高效且准确地基于输入生成3D对象的组装部分，显著提升了3D生成的质量和灵活性。

**Abstract:** We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

**Motivation:** 打破对传统固定参考视图的依赖，以提供稳健的视角重建方法，避免由于参考视图次优导致的不稳定性和错误。

**Method:** 介绍了一种名为$\pi^3$的前馈神经网络，该模型采用完全置换等变架构预测仿射不变的相机姿态和尺度不变的局部点映射，不依赖任何参考帧，从而提升了模型对于输入顺序的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

**Result:** 该模型在相机姿态估计、单目/视频深度估计和密集点映射重建等多种任务中，展示出了最先进的性能。

**Conclusion:** 这种方法提供了一种简单的且无偏的方法来实现各种任务的最优性能。代码和模型已公开。

**Abstract:** We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

**Method:** 通过引入批量耦合技术调整分层递归流匹配中不同层次的分布复杂性。

**Conclusion:** 批量耦合技术在优化分层递归流匹配中的多模态处理方面表现出色，增进了合成和成像数据的处理效果。

**Abstract:** Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

**Motivation:** 文章动机在于解决现有无监督方法在处理长视频理解复杂场景时的不足，通过引入一种基于用户指令定制的帧采样方法来提升视频大型语言模型（Video-LLMs）的性能。

**Method:** 文章提出的方法是VideoITG（指令式时间定位视频），核心是VidThinker管线，它模拟人类注释过程进行帧的采样，过程包括生成详细的片段说明、基于指令的视频片段检索以及精细化帧的选择。

**Result:** {cause: '分析文章摘要', effect: '提供了有关VideoITG的信息'}

**Conclusion:** VideoITG结合Video-LLMs在多种多模态视频理解基准测试中表现出持续的性能提升，展示了其在视频理解方面的优越性和巨大潜力。

**Abstract:** Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.
