To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal\nSearch, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal\nregions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key\nobservation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal\nintervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through\ntwo main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is\nlikely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos.

Several data-efficient training\nstrategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset\nselection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,\nenabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing\ncomputational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on\ngradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However,\ndeveloping a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across\ndiverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks\nand remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative\nMisclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by\ncurriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to\nidentify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process,\nwhile prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare\noutcomes.

In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing\nVLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,\nand a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically\nanalyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals\npsychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,\nwe investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size\ninfluence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated\nquestions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit\nstronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting\nincreasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human\nsubject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural\ndifferences between VLMs and human respondents.
