**Conclusion:** 结论：未来的大规模语言模型发展应聚焦于利用有限资源和少量专业知识情况下实现高效实际应用，以减少碳排放和减少技术不平等。

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable, but the most celebrated efficiency methods -- mixture-of-experts (MoE), speculative decoding, and complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- were built for hyperscale providers with vast infrastructure and elite teams. Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark. By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, we can democratize LLM deployment -- ensuring that optimization reduces inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them.

### [2] [Harmonic Token Projection (HTP): A Vocabulary-Free, Training-Free, Deterministic, and Reversible Embedding Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20665)
*Tcharlies Schmitz*

Main category: cs.CL

> The paper presents Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a deterministic framework for generating text embeddings that avoid training and stochastic parameters, achieving high similarity scores and stable cross-lingual performance with low computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to provide a transparent, efficient, and deterministic method for generating text embeddings that can maintain stable performance across multiple languages, without the need for training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters.

**Method:** This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a framework which generates text embeddings analytically from Unicode representations, creating a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space, which preserves structure and enables semantic similarity estimation through geometric alignment.

**Result:** The paper demonstrates that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of ρ = 0.68 on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) in English and maintains stable performance across ten languages with low computational cost and latency.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that meaningful semantic relations can be generated through deterministic geometric methods, offering an efficient and transparent alternative to data-driven approaches.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a reversible and deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters. Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings. Keywords: Harmonic Token Projection, reversible embedding, deterministic encoding, semantic similarity, multilingual representation.

> The paper presents a dual-embedding centroid-based classification framework for text classification in hierarchical taxonomies, specifically for IT Service Management (ITSM) systems. This method achieves competitive performance with SVMs while offering faster training and incremental updates, suitable for practical ITSM environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve text classification in ITSM systems, enabling efficient and interpretable categorization of support tickets into a hierarchical structure, while also addressing the need for faster training and update times.

**Method:** The dual-embedding method maintains separate semantic and lexical centroid representations for each category and combines them via reciprocal rank fusion during inference.

**Result:** The method shows competitive performance (hierarchical F1: 0.731 vs 0.727 with SVMs) on 8,968 ITSM tickets across 123 categories. It provides a 5.9 times faster training speed and up to 152 times faster incremental updates compared to baseline methods.

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework is suitable for production ITSM environments due to its performance, interpretability, and operational efficiency.

**Abstract:** Text classification with hierarchical taxonomies is a fundamental requirement in IT Service Management (ITSM) systems, where support tickets must be categorized into tree-structured taxonomies. We present a dual-embedding centroid-based classification framework that maintains separate semantic and lexical centroid representations per category, combining them through reciprocal rank fusion at inference time. The framework achieves performance competitive with Support Vector Machines (hierarchical F1: 0.731 vs 0.727) while providing interpretability through centroid representations. Evaluated on 8,968 ITSM tickets across 123 categories, this method achieves 5.9 times faster training and up to 152 times faster incremental updates. With 8.6-8.8 times speedup across batch sizes (100-1000 samples) when excluding embedding computation. These results make the method suitable for production ITSM environments prioritizing interpretability and operational efficiency.

### [4] [PIRA: Preference-Oriented Instruction-Tuned Reward Models with Dual Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20668)
*Yongfu Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

> PIRA是一个新的训练范式，通过重新表述问题-答案对、聚合多样化的偏好任务以及平均不同dropout率下的value-head输出，来提高奖励模型的数据效率并减少过度优化风险。实验表明PIRA是有效的。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统的区分性奖励模型在提高大型语言模型与人类偏好对齐时存在数据效率低下和奖励过度优化的问题。

**Method:** PIRA通过三种策略来应对挑战：(1) 将问题-答案对重释为基于偏好的指令，(2) 聚合来自多种偏好任务的奖励，(3) 平均不同dropout率下的value-head输出。

**Result:** 实验结果表明了PIRA的有效性。

**Conclusion:** PIRA范式在提升奖励模型的数据效率和缓解过度优化方面展现出了良好的效果。

**Abstract:** Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.

### [5] [Structured Definitions and Segmentations for Legal Reasoning in LLMs: A Study on Indian Legal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20669)
*Mann Khatri,Mirza Yusuf,Rajiv Ratn Shah,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本研究评估了大语言模型在法律任务上的表现，并通过三种零样本实验方法展示了结构性重组文件和解释性定义法律术语能显著提升模型的表现，至少在F1分数上提高了1.5%，最多提高了4.36%。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于LLM在法律等特定领域会面临挑战，特别是在缺乏领域特定预训练的情况下。面对法律文件复杂的特性和长度，常规的LLM难以有效处理。因此，本研究旨在分析LLM在法律任务上的行为表现。

**Method:** 本研究采用实验方法，在无需全面领域对齐的情况下，通过三种任务来试验LLM在法律任务上的行为表现。这三个任务分别是：(i)基于修辞角色重组文件以评估结构化信息对长文本处理和模型决策的影响；(ii)定义修辞角色来帮助模型熟悉法律术语；(iii)模拟法院围绕修辞角色的逐步推理过程以增强模型推理能力。这些实验在零样本的环境下，使用了三个印度法律判决预测数据集进行。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，通过数据组织或解释关键法律术语，模型性能有了显著改善，F1分数最少提高了约1.5%，最多提高了4.36%相较于基线。

**Conclusion:** 本研究得出结论认为，在法律任务上，通过重组数据结构和解释关键法律术语可以显著提升LLM的性能表现。这对于需要处理长文本和专业术语的任务提供了一条低成本高效益的优化方法。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

### [6] [MindSET: Advancing Mental Health Benchmarking through Large-Scale Social Media Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20672)
*Saad Mankarious,Ayah Zirikly,Daniel Wiechmann,Elma Kerz,Edward Kempa,Yu Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

> A new benchmark dataset, MindSET, was created to improve the study of mental health through social media analysis, providing both quantity and quality of data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the limitations of existing benchmark datasets in mental health analysis, specifically their outdated nature and inadequate cleaning, by providing a robust, large-scale dataset for studying social media and mental health.

**Method:** Social media data was curated from Reddit for seven mental health conditions to form the new MindSET benchmark dataset. Rigorous preprocessing steps were applied to ensure data quality before conducting binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection.

**Result:** Models trained on the new MindSET dataset outperformed those on previous benchmarks, showing significant improvement in F1 scores, specifically up to an 18-point improvement in F1 for Autism detection.

**Conclusion:** MindSET presents a valuable resource for research in the intersection of social media and mental health, enabling more insightful analysis and early risk detection for mental health conditions.

**Abstract:** Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.

*Zheng Hui,Xiaokai Wei,Reza Shirkavand,Chen Wang,Weizhi Zhang,Alejandro Peláez,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

> 该研究提出了FlexCode，一种新的受欢迎度感知框架，能够在协同过滤（CF）词典和语义词典之间灵活分配标记预算，以此提升生成推荐系统的精度和对长尾项目的鲁棒性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的方法依赖于单一的统一词典来编码所有项目，这忽视了流行项目与长尾项目之间的失衡问题，从而限制了表征效率和泛化能力。

**Method:** 提出了一种基于受欢迎度的框架FlexCode，该框架能够在协同过滤代码本和语义代码本之间自适应分配固定标记数量。该方法通过一个轻量级的MoE来平衡两者之间的精确度和泛化能力，并通过一个对齐和平滑目标来维持跨受欢迎度范围的一致性。

**Result:** 在公开数据集和工业级数据集上的实验表明，FlexCode能一直超越强大的基线模型，在各种推荐指标上表现更优。

**Conclusion:** FlexCode不仅为基于生成的方法提供了新的标记表示机制，而且提供了一种如何在基于标记的推荐模型中平衡记忆和泛化的新视角。

**Abstract:** Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 目标是填补阿拉伯语跨域文本到SQL任务的研究空白，并通过GPT模型和新提出的方法改进执行和交互准确性。

**Method:** 使用GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4.5-turbo在10种提示工程技术，包括四种问题表示方法和六种上下文学习技术上进行了实验，并提出了GAT corrector方法。

**Result:** 实验结果显示GAT corrector在零样本和上下文学习设置下分别提升了1.9%的执行准确性和交互准确性，以及1.72% EX和0.92% IX的增量。

**Conclusion:** GAT corrector方法提供了一种有效的方法来改善阿拉伯语环境下的文本到SQL任务的性能。

**Abstract:** In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.

> 本研究揭示了大型语言模型在临床决策支持中出现了推理错误，这些错误与认知偏差有关，可能导致临床指南不符且潜在有害的建议，尤其是在晚期疾病管理中。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型即使在临床基准上表现出高性能，也可能通过错误的推理得出正确的结论，这种失败模式在肿瘤决策支持方面存在安全问题，而这一问题并未被基于准确性的评估所捕捉。研究旨在开发和验证一种评估和改进大型语言模型推理准确性的框架。

**Method:** 本研究是一个两队列的回顾性研究，开发了一个推理错误的层级分类法，并使用了CORAL数据集中的乳腺癌和胰腺癌患者的病历注释了600个推理路径，定义了一个三级分类法，将计算故障映射到认知偏差框架。随后，通过822个前列腺癌会诊病历验证了该分类法，在不同阶段疾病（从局部到转移）中模拟了抽取、分析和临床推荐任务。

**Result:** 推理错误出现在23%的解释中，占据总体错误的主导地位，确认偏差和锚定偏差最为常见。自动化评估器使用最先进的语言模型可以检测错误的存在但不能可靠地分类子类型。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，当推理存在问题时，大型语言模型可能会给出流畅但具有临床安全隐患的建议。该分类法提供了一个通用框架，评估并改进推理精度，以确保在临床部署前模型的安全性。

**Abstract:** Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

### [10] [Dynamic Template Selection for Output Token Generation Optimization: MLP-Based and Transformer Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20683)
*Bharadwaj Yadavalli*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究提出了一种动态模板选择（DTS）方法来解决大型语言模型在处理不同类型查询时产生的令牌效率低下的问题，通过对比MLP和RoBERTa两种路由方法，以及跨供应商的广泛试验，证明了其通用性和有效性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现代大型语言模型通常采用统一的提示策略处理各种查询类型，但这会导致令牌使用效率低下，特别是输出令牌成本高达4-8倍。DTS方法解决了这一问题，有效减少了成本而没有牺牲响应质量。

**Method:** 提出了动态模板选择（DTS）方法，该方法根据查询复杂度自适应匹配响应模板。研究对比了两种路由方法：一种是简单的MLP，利用预计算的嵌入；另一种是更复杂的微调RoBERTa transformer。

**Result:** 通过在1,000个MMLU问题上的综合评估，发现MLP路由的路由准确率达到90.5%，略微超过RoBERTa的性能（89.5%），同时使用了少125M参数。经验分析表明模板选择在供应商间具有通用性，经9,000次生产API调用验证，路由准确性保持在90.5%，但不同供应商的生成特征导致了32.6%至33.9%的可变标记减少。

**Conclusion:** 本研究贡献包括机器学习理论基础上的正式问题设定，四个算法及其复杂性分析，以及在生产系统上的广泛经验验证。

**Abstract:** Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.
  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.
  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.

*Trung Cuong Dang,David Mohaisen*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一个新的记忆化定义和检测框架，通过外部对抗搜索识别记忆序列和非记忆序列，以评估大型语言模型的数据泄露风险。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型在大量语料库上训练时，容易逐字记忆训练数据，造成显著的隐私和版权风险。虽然以前的工作提出了各种记忆化的定义，但许多定义在全面捕捉这一现象方面存在不足，特别是在对齐模型中。为了应对这一挑战。

**Method:** 提出了一种新的框架：多前缀记忆。核心见解是，记忆序列被深度编码，可以通过比非记忆内容显著更多的不同前缀检索到。通过定义如果外部对抗搜索可以识别出一个目标数量的不同前缀来触发它，则该序列为记忆化的。

**Result:** 实验表明，多前缀定义可以可靠地区分记忆化的和非记忆化的数据，为评估大型语言模型中的数据泄露提供了一个强大的实用工具。

**Conclusion:** 提出的方法通过量化记忆的检索路径的多样性来可靠地区分记忆化和非记忆化数据，提供了评估大型语言模型中数据泄露风险的强大工具。

**Abstract:** Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

> SAGE introduces an advanced framework to interpret the opaque features generated by Sparse Autoencoders in language models, resulting in more interpretable models with improved generative and predictive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the lack of transparency in large language models (LLMs) and the challenge of interpreting features extracted by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), which are essential for enhancing the safe and reliable deployment of these models.

**Method:** SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework, is introduced to interpret features captured by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) in large language models (LLMs). This methodology systematically formulates multiple explanations for features, designs targeted experiments to test these explanations, and iteratively refines the explanations based on feedback from empirical activation, thereby making the process active and explanation-driven.

**Result:** Experiments on features from SAEs of various language models show that SAGE generates explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

**Conclusion:** The proposed framework, SAGE, effectively enhances the interpretability of LLMs by producing more accurate and insightful explanations for the features captured by SAEs, contributing to the safe deployment of such models.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

**Motivation:** 随着语言模型越来越多地被各领域采纳，高质量的基准测试框架对于指导部署决策变得至关重要。现有的框架如HELM尽管可以在广义任务中进行评价，但往往依赖于固定的提示无法泛化到不同的模型，导致性能估计不准确。该研究旨在通过引入一种新的框架来解决这个问题，以实现更准确的性能评估。

**Method:** 该研究利用了DSPy+HELM框架，并采用四种提示方法，评估了四个前沿语言模型在七个基准测试（通用与医疗领域）上的表现，同时与现存的HELM基线分数进行了对比。

**Result:** 该论文提出了一种可重复的DSPy+HELM框架，引入了能够激发推理的结构化提示方法，以实现更准确的语言模型基准测试。研究发现在没有结构化提示的情况下，HELM框架低估了语言模型的表现，表现估算在不同基准测试中的变异度更大，并且会错误呈现性能差异。此外，引入推理减少了模型对提示设计的敏感度。这是首次大规模的基准测试研究，旨在通过可扩展的性能上限估计，提高决策导向的基准测试实用性。研究还开源了DSPy+HELM集成和提示优化管道。

**Conclusion:** 研究表明，没有结构化的提示方法，现有的HELM框架低估了语言模型的表现，并且方法之间以及不同基准之间的性能变异度更大。通过引入推理机制（如链式思考），语言模型对提示设计的敏感度有所降低。首次的大规模研究证实，可扩展性能上限的评估能够提升基准测试的实际决策价值。

**Abstract:** As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).

### [15] [Length-MAX Tokenizer for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20849)
*Dong Dong,Weijie Su*

Main category: cs.CL

> 本文提出了一种新的分词器，称为Length-MAX，通过优化平均字符数来减少文本表示的词数，相较于Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)，在不同模型规模和词汇量上都显示出较少的训练步数、较低的推理延迟以及更好的下游任务性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 为了提高语言模型的效率，减少所需的训练步数和推理延迟，并在不牺牲甚至提高下游任务性能的情况下优化模型。

**Method:** Length-MAX通过将长度加权目标最大化转化为图划分问题并开发了一种贪婪近似算法来获得词汇表。

**Result:** 与BPE相比，Length-MAX在不同词汇量下能够将词数减少14-18%，并能够在不同的GPT-2模型规模中表现出较少的训练步数和较低的推理延迟，同时在下游任务中表现出改善的性能。

**Conclusion:** 该研究证明了通过优化平均词长度来实现更高效的语言模型是可行的，并表明Length-MAX分词器在生产系统中具有兼容性，且能够在推理阶段减少嵌入和KV缓存的内存。

**Abstract:** We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.

> The paper presents Evo-Memory, a framework evaluating dynamic memory management in LLMs across evolving task streams, with focus on methods to continuously integrate and update memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this paper is to address the limitation of existing LLMs in dynamic memory management and learning from accumulated interactions in continuous task streams.

**Method:** The paper introduces Evo-Memory, a streaming benchmark and framework that requires large language models (LLMs) to manage memory dynamically across evolving task streams. It evaluates over ten memory modules across various datasets and proposes two methods: ExpRAG for reusing prior experience and ReMem for continuous memory refinement.

**Result:** The results of the paper are not detailed in the abstract, but they evaluate various memory modules on diverse datasets and propose baseline methods for memory retrieval and continuous improvement.

**Conclusion:** The conclusion of the paper is implied in the presentation of Evo-Memory and the proposed methods, indicating a step towards better dynamic memory management and continual learning in LLMs.

**Abstract:** Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 本论文旨在利用跨语言方法解决低资源语言的论证挖掘问题。

**Method:** 本研究提出了三种训练方案来实现跨语言的论证挖掘，其中包括零样本迁移学习、基于大型语言模型生成的增强训练方案，以及结合英语数据和手工翻译的波斯语句子的跨语言模型。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，基于大型语言模型增强的模型在英语和波斯语文本上的F1分数分别达到了59.2%和69.3%，而结合了两种语言数据的跨语言模型在波斯语文本上取得了74.8%的F1分数。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，轻量级的跨语言结合可以显著优于更耗资源的数据增强方法，为低资源语言的论证挖掘提供了一种实用策略。

**Abstract:** Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.

> The study finds that large language models implement abstract semantics through compact mechanisms that are somewhat conserved across different model architectures and scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To better understand and characterize the internal mechanisms of large language models that support abstract semantic structures.

**Method:** The paper integrates role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison methods to study the semantic mechanism of large language models.

**Result:** Highly concentrated circuits, gradual structural refinement without phase transitions, bypassing in larger models, moderate component overlap, and high spectral similarity across different scales.

**Conclusion:** The mechanism within large language models for implementing abstract semantic roles is compact, causally isolated, and partially transferable across different scales and architecture types.

**Abstract:** Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.

*Reham Omar,Abdelghny Orogat,Ibrahim Abdelaziz,Omij Mangukiya,Panos Kalnis,Essam Mansour*

> 本文介绍了Chatty-KG系统，它通过模块化设计结合多智能体有效处理基于知识图谱的多轮对话问题，展现出优于当前最先进技术的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的KG问答系统和支持对话系统的大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理结构化、不断演变及企业内部知识图谱时存在多轮对话的上下文追踪能力不足、延迟高和无法直接访问的情况。Chatty-KG旨在解决这些问题。

**Method:** Chatty-KG是一个模块化的多智能体系统，结合了RAG风格的检索和结构化执行，通过任务特化的LLM智能体生成SPARQL查询。这些智能体在对话上下文的解释、对话追踪、实体和关系链接以及有效的查询规划方面进行协作，实现自然问题向可执行查询的准确和低延迟转换。

**Result:** 实验显示，Chatty-KG在大范围多样的知识图谱上，相较于最先进的基线系统，在单轮和多轮场景中均表现出更高的F1和P@1分数。此外，Chatty-KG具有良好的对话连贯性和支持演变中的知识图谱的能力。评估显示，该系统兼容各类型的LLM，并保持稳定性能。

**Conclusion:** Chatty-KG统一了对话灵活性和结构化KG的绑定，提供了一个可扩展，可靠的方式来进行多轮的KG问答。

**Abstract:** Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.

Main category: cs.CL

> 通过TrackList分析了预训练数据对大型语言模型回答多样化语言查询性能的影响，结果表明LGM在定义型问题上表现最佳，但在实例化问题上较差，且更倾向于对流行频繁知识进行同义阐述。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 大型语言模型在响应用户查询时能够有效地提供定义型答案，但对于给出具象化或同义表述这类回答时，模型性能有所下降。该研究旨在探索预训练数据对多样化语言查询的性能衰减影响。

**Method:** 使用TrackList进行评估，这是一种精细的语言和统计分析流水线，用于调查预训练数据对大型语言模型回答多样化语言查询的影响。同时引入了RefoMed-EN数据集，包含6170个经过人工标注的医学术语及其对应的定义、名称、实例说明或同义词。研究探讨了概念高频率与低频率对语言模型性能的影响。

**Result:** 研究表明，在定义型问题上，语言模型的表现最佳，而在实例化型问题上表现最差。此外，对于定义型问题，大型语言模型倾向于在流行且频繁的知识内容上进行更多同义阐述，而在尾部和专业知识上则较少。

**Conclusion:** 大型语言模型在对多样化类型的查询进行回答时遇到挑战，尤其是对于那些不常见或更专业化的知识。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.

### [21] [Semantic Anchors in In-Context Learning: Why Small LLMs Cannot Flip Their Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21038)
*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

> 研究探讨了在上下文学习中（ICL），预训练的标签语义是否可以被覆盖或仅仅是被精炼。通过自然和反转标签展示实验，发现ICL主要是在调整输入如何映射到预训练的语义方向上，而不是灵活地重新映射标签含义。这表明在这些规模上要覆盖标签语义需要超出ICL的干预措施。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 探索ICL在分类任务中的学习机制，特别是它是否能够覆盖预训练模型中已经学习到的语义标签。自然标签展示和反转标签展示对比实验设计为验证这个前提提供了可能。

**Method:** 将大语言模型看作是prompt引导的分类器，通过对比自然展示（使用正确标签）和反转展示（系统性翻转标签含义）两种条件下的模型行为，分解ICL行为为三个对齐度量。引入语义覆盖率作为指标，测试这些模型在反转语义下是否能进行有效学习。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，使用自然样例展示时，ICL能够提高准确率同时保持较强的先验对齐；反转样例展示下，模型难以学会一致的反语义分类器，模型的准确率随着对反转标签提示的对齐度增加而下降，发现ICL无法覆盖原有的语义。

**Conclusion:** ICL主要调整输入如何映射到预训练的语义方向上，而不是灵活地重新映射标签含义。这表明在这些规模模型上不能依靠ICL来覆盖预训练的语义标签，可能需要其他干预手段来实现这一目标。这解释了少量样本提示的基本限制。所有代码公开可用。

**Abstract:** Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL. All code is available at: https://github.com/AnanthaPadmanaban-KrishnaKumar/semantic-anchors-icl.

> 作者提出了一种基于检索的方法来增强MPL在讽刺文本识别中的表现，通过两种不同手段提升上下文理解能力，并展示该方法在多个数据集上的优异表现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于讽刺文本的复杂性以及语言多样性和文化差异性，即使是目前最先进的预训练语言模型和大模型，在讽刺检测任务上仍表现不稳定。

**Method:** 该研究在一种名为PMP的提示方法的基础上，引入了一种基于检索的方法，以结合被检测文本的上下文信息。具体来说，他们探索了两种提供上下文信息的方法：一个是通过网络检索补充外部知识，另一个是通过模型自身的内部知识来提供自我知识意识策略。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，基于网页检索的非参数知识方法在Twitter印尼讽刺数据集上，相比PMP方法提高了9.87%的宏观F1。而基于自我知识的检索方法在SemEval和MUStARD数据集上分别提高了3.29%和4.08%的宏观F1。

**Conclusion:** 研究指出，在讽刺检测任务中，背景信息特别是文化相关的俚语、引用以及对大模型来说未知的术语，对于提升模型性能极为关键。未来工作的重点将放在优化相关背景信息的检索方法以及评估获取信息质量对性能的影响。

**Abstract:** Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance. The experiment code is available at: https://github.com/wllchrst/sarcasm-detection_pmp_knowledge-base.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 在像缅甸语这样的低资源语言中，分类任务经常只微调最终的分类层，保持预训练编码器权重不变。然而固定非线性的多层感知器（MLPs）可能限制了表达能力并增加了计算成本。

**Method:** 本研究探索了Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 作为分类任务中的替代分类器，评估了基于傅立叶的FourierKAN，基于样条的EfficientKAN，以及基于网格的FasterKAN，在多种嵌入方式下（包括TF-IDF，fastText和多语言转换器模型mBERT和Distil-mBERT）的表现。

**Result:** 实验结果表明KAN基分类头比MLP具有竞争力并有时候更优。EfficientKAN结合fastText达到了最高的F1分数（0.928），而FasterKAN提供了速度和准确性之间的最佳平衡。在转换器嵌入上，EfficientKAN与MLP持平或稍有超过，使用mBERT时F1分数为0.917。

**Conclusion:** 这些发现强调了KANs作为一种表达能力强且效率高的多层感知器替代选项在低资源语言分类任务中的价值。

**Abstract:** In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To assess how large language models satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, given the current limited cross-architecture evaluations.

**Method:** We evaluate 28 configurations across three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction.

**Result:** Architectural differences produce larger F1 score gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families and show inconsistent budget sensitivity. Models fail systematically on orthographically atypical words.

**Conclusion:** The research suggests that specialized architectural features or training objectives may be necessary for constraint satisfaction, beyond just increasing parameters or computational budgets.

**Abstract:** Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography ("data", "poop", "loll": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation of this study is to address ASR error correction problems specifically for the Burmese language, which is a low-resource language.

**Method:** This paper focuses on different feature integration strategies, including IPA and alignment information, for sequence-to-sequence Transformer models to correct automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors in low-resource Burmese.

**Result:** The proposed AEC model, with the use of IPA and alignment features, improved word-level and character-level accuracies compared to the baseline ASR models. Specifically, the WER was reduced from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation and 43.59 after augmentation; the chrF++ score improved from 0.5864 to 0.627.

**Conclusion:** The research results indicate the robustness of ASR error correction methods and emphasize the importance of feature design for improving the performance of ASR in low-resource language environments.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.

**Conclusion:** 通过在抵押融资本领域的应用证明了模型的有效性，模型架构以及任务路由机制能够大大提升专业领域内大型语言模型的表现。

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

### [27] [Self-Guided Defense: Adaptive Safety Alignment for Reasoning Models via Synthesized Guidelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21214)
*Yuhang Wang,Yanxu Zhu,Dongyuan Lu,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.CL

> The paper presents the SGASA framework to enhance safety in reasoning models by generating and embedding safety guidelines, improving resistance to adversarial prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To address the challenge of ensuring safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts in reasoning models, which can lead to harmful content generation.

**Method:** This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework. It consists of two stages: 1. Data Pre-synthesis, where it generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts. 2. Alignment Fine-tuning, which embeds those guidelines into the model using Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

**Result:** The extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that the SGASA framework significantly enhances model safety and robustness against adversarial prompts, while minimizing the rejection of benign requests.

**Conclusion:** The SGASA framework is effective and scalable for improving the safety of reasoning models, allowing them to autonomously reinforce their defenses against adversarial inputs.

**Abstract:** Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

**Motivation:** 本文旨在探讨通过小样本人类调查数据对大型语言模型进行微调是否能够改善其与人类行为的一致性问题，尤其是在回应多样化、子组一致性以及信仰与行为一致性方面。

**Method:** 本研究通过行为实验探讨了在信息披露领域，基于一小部分人类调查数据对大型语言模型（LLM）进行微调是否可以改善模型的异质性、子组一致性以及信仰-行动一致性等问题，并将人类和LLM生成的响应进行多维度比较，包括分布差异、子组一致性、信仰-行动一致性以及回归系数的恢复。

**Result:** 研究发现，基于小样本人类数据的微调显著提升了模型在异质性、一致性和信仰-行动一致性方面的表现，但仍未能重现原始研究的回归系数，表明LLM生成的数据仍然不适合替代人类参与者进行正式的推断分析。

**Conclusion:** 即使经过微调，LLM生成的数据也无法完全替代人类参与者在正式统计分析中的作用，尽管它在某些方面有了明显的改善，但在精确捕捉人类行为的复杂性上仍然存在局限性。因此，当前阶段不宜过度依赖LLM来取代人类在调查和实验研究中的角色。

**Abstract:** There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

**Method:** 通过对缺乏标准化正写法的Isan语言建立实用的转录协议，解决了转录指南设计的复杂性以及一致性、可用性和语言真实性的问题。

**Result:** 该数据集作为开放资源发布，旨在支持AI的包容性发展，促进对代表较少的语言的研究，并为解决对话语音的语言和技术挑战提供了基础。

**Conclusion:** 通过创建首个Isan语言开放对话语音数据集，解决了语音数据集中正写法缺乏的问题，并支持了AI包容性和对于非主流语言的研究。

**Abstract:** This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 鉴于大型语言模型（LLMs）虽然在许多任务上取得了最先进的性能，但其庞大的规模导致了高昂的计算和环境成本，限制了其可访问性。因此，提出了参数高效的微调（PEFT）方法来减少可训练参数的数量，同时保持强大的下游性能。然而，当前的PEFT方法评估仍有局限性和难以复现的问题。为了弥补这一缺口，本文引入了PEFT-Bench。

**Method:** Content

**Result:** 

**Conclusion:** 本文通过引入PEFT-Bench和PEFT软评分惩罚（PSCP）指标，旨在解决评估不同PEFT方法在自回归LLMs上的局限性，提高了评估的可复现性并考虑到了PEFT训练和推理的不同因素。

**Abstract:** Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 首次系统性地研究了神经语言模型训练过程中由马丁定律描述的词频与多义性之间的经验性关系。

**Method:** 使用DBSCAN聚类分析上下文化嵌入以实现词义的操作化，并分析了四个不同参数规模的Pythia模型（70M-1B参数），总共分析了30个训练检查点。

**Result:** 研究结果揭示了非单调的发展轨迹：马丁定律在第100个检查点出现，在第104个检查点达到约0.6的峰值相关度，但在第105个检查点降低。小模型(70M, 160M)在后期检查点中经历了灾难性的语义崩溃，大模型(410M, 1B)则表现得相对稳定。频率-特异性权衡在整个模型上保持稳定(r $\approx$ -0.3)。

**Conclusion:** 研究显示，语言模型生成文本中对语言规则的遵守并非随着训练时间单调递增，而是遵循一个最优语义窗口下的平衡轨迹。这项工作建立了一种评估神经语言模型中语言结构出现的方法论。

**Abstract:** We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 探讨Lindsey (2025)研究中关于语言模型是否可以检测和识别注入的激活模式的能力，尝试通过直接训练而非等待其自然出现的方式来提升该能力。

**Method:** 通过微调在瞬态单令牌注入上训练模型，以实现对注入的“思想”的可靠检测。最终将一个70亿参数的模型从近乎完全失败（0.4%准确性，6.7%假阳性率）提升至可靠检测（85%准确性，0%假阳性率）。

**Result:** 模型能够检测到短暂的单一令牌位置上的“思想”，并能保留这些信息，跨多个生成步骤报告其语义内容，满足Lindsey的三个标准：准确性、关联性及内在性。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果解决了Lindsey提出的开放问题，证明了可以通过直接训练诱导出部分内省行为，为构建内置AI透明度提供了途径。

**Abstract:** Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.

**Motivation:** 在线新闻文章的用户评论中经常传播错误信息，迫切需要有效的方法来检测事实上的错误信息。为了支持或反驳从这些评论中提取的声明，需要识别相关的文档并找出具体文本片段来支持或反驳每个声明。

**Method:** 本文关注从捷克语和斯洛伐克语评论中抽取细粒度证据的任务。创建了一个新的数据集，该数据集包含由付费注释员完成的双向注释细粒度证据。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，尽管llama3.1:8b模型相对较小，但其正确输出的比例较高。相比之下，大量参数的gpt-oss-120b模型表现较差。qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b以及gpt-oss:20b模型则在模型大小和与人类注释的一致性之间达到了有效平衡。

**Conclusion:** 大型语言模型在细粒度证据抽取任务中，常常会从源文本中直接复制证据，导致输出无效。实验结果显示了不同模型大小和其与人类注释一致性之间的权衡。

**Abstract:** Misinformation frequently spreads in user comments under online news articles, highlighting the need for effective methods to detect factually incorrect information. To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.

**Motivation:** 由于现有的分解-征服推理方法，尤其是基于Chain-of-Thought的方法，在处理复杂企业数据库时存在诸如上下文容量有限、模式链接不可靠以及与数据库语义弱关联的问题，因此提出DSR-SQL以克服这些限制。

**Method:** 内容介绍了一种名为DSR-SQL的框架，该框架采用双状态推理方法解决复杂企业数据库中的文本到SQL问题。第一个状态创建了一个紧凑且语义准确的环境，第二个状态则将SQL合成视为反馈导向的状态转换，使模型能够自我修正并符合用户意图。

**Result:** DSR-SQL在没有后期训练或环境内示例的情况下，达到了对手数据库Spider 2.0-Snow 35.28%的执行准确率和BIRD开发集68.32%的准确率。

**Conclusion:** 研究成果表明，DSR-SQL框架能够有效解决将文本转换为SQL时遇到的上下文限制和模式链接问题，并且即使在没有额外训练的情况下也能达到较高的执行准确率。

**Abstract:** Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.

**Motivation:** 解决现有方法在处理文本化图时的问题，现有的方法或是受限于过平滑和跳数相关的扩散问题的GNN，或是忽略图拓扑并把节点视为孤立序列的Transformer模型。

**Method:** Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration)，通过定向的双模块机制在特定深度向Transformers注入图结构，不同于依赖多跳扩散的消息传递GNN，Odin在特定的Transformer层融合多跳结构，形成与模型语义层次相一致的低、中、高级结构抽象。聚合操作基于全局[CLS]表示，从根本上避免过度平滑，并解耦结构抽象与邻域大小或图拓扑的依赖。

**Result:** 实验表明Odin达到了最先进的准确度，而Light Odin在减少计算成本的同时提供了具有竞争力的性能。

**Conclusion:** Odin和Light Odin共同形成了一种统一、非依赖跳数的原则性结构文本融合框架。

**Abstract:** Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** to evaluate the effectiveness of model merging on large language models (LLMs) and understand if performance improvements observed in smaller models can be replicated

**Method:** model merging techniques, including Task Arithmetic, interference-aware and subspace merging methods

**Result:** Task Arithmetic is the only merging method that consistently provides performance gains on LLMs; other methods lead to performance drops

**Conclusion:** current merging techniques do not generalize well to modern LLMs, which calls for LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods

**Abstract:** Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

**Abstract:** Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

**Motivation:** 当前研究主要集中在对单模态AI-ML系统的隐私攻击分析，而最近的研究表明，多模态模型也可能容易受到隐私攻击。本研究旨在探讨神经启发的多模态模型是否能抵御隐私攻击。

**Method:** 本研究引入了一个系统性的神经科学启发的拓扑正则化（tau）框架，用于分析多模态视觉语言模型（VLMs）对基于图像-文本推理隐私攻击的抗性。

**Result:** 实验结果表明，在COCO数据集上，BLIP模型的神经VLM版本（tau > 0配置）的MIA攻击成功率降低了24%的平均ROC-AUC，而模型效用保持不变。

**Conclusion:** 该研究表明，神经VLMs在抵抗隐私攻击方面较为稳健，为多模态模型的隐私风险理解提供了新的证据。

**Abstract:** In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

**Method:** semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, optimized for generating long, physically realistic, and interactive videos through block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones

**Result:** Inferix, a next-generation inference engine for immersive world synthesis with interactive video streaming, profiling, and efficient benchmarking

**Conclusion:** Inferix represents a significant advancement in immersive world simulation through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding, setting a new standard for next-generation vision models and encouraging community-driven exploration of world models

**Abstract:** World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

**Motivation:** 移动边缘计算的进步使得将计算密集型对象检测卸载到边缘服务器成为可能，需要解决何时进行边缘检测与本地跟踪的问题。

**Method:** 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的算法LTED-Ada，该算法根据帧率、识别准确性和延迟要求自适应地选择本地跟踪或边缘检测。在多设备情况下，通过联邦学习来增强LTED-Ada，实现设备间的协同策略训练。

**Result:** 通过使用多个Raspberry Pi 4B设备和一台个人电脑作为边缘服务器进行了广泛的实验，结果表明提出的LTED-Ada方法能够有效地提高资源受限设备上的视频对象识别准确性和速度。

**Conclusion:** 实验结果显示，LTED-Ada在硬件环测试环境下表现出色，证明了该方法在视频对象识别中的有效性和优越性。

**Abstract:** Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

> DeeAD accelerates the inference process in VLA models for autonomous driving by implementing an early-exit technique that assesses trajectory feasibility, achieving a notable reduction in latency without affecting planning quality or safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind DeeAD is to address the significant inference latency issue associated with deep transformer stacks in VLA models, which are used for autonomous driving tasks.

**Method:** DeeAD is a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates the inference process of Vision-Language Action (VLA) models by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories and terminating inference when the predicted trajectories match lightweight planning priors.

**Result:** Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark show up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and a 29% reduction in latency while preserving the quality and safety of planning.

**Conclusion:** The DeeAD framework effectively improves the efficiency of VLA models for autonomous driving by reducing inference latency without compromising the quality of trajectory planning.

**Abstract:** Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有压缩技术在创建高效模型时牺牲了基础模型的通用性。本研究旨在压缩大型自监督学习模型，同时保留其在下游任务中的通用性。

**Method:** 基础模型蒸馏（FMD）的方法，将大型自监督学习模型压缩成紧凑且高效的代理模型，同时保留其通用表示能力。具体实施方式包括训练一个student模型来学习teacher模型的token级表示的压缩集，即SuperTokens，以捕捉teacher模型的潜在空间的紧凑基。

**Result:** 通过FMD方法，单个蒸馏模型在分类、部件分割和少样本场景等多样化下游任务中表现良好，几乎达到完整基础模型的性能，同时使用了更少的token和FLOPs。

**Conclusion:** FMD实现了将基础模型压缩至更为紧凑和高效的形态，同时保持强大下游任务适应性，使其更适用于资源受限硬件的部署。

**Abstract:** Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** To develop a robust model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting that remains effective even after post-processing, such as resizing, noise addition, and compression.

**Method:** We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based method for detecting manipulated regions in images by adding a linear classification head to the Vision Transformer’s patch embeddings. A sliding-window approach is used for larger images and post-processing refines the manipulation masks.

**Result:** DinoLizer outperforms existing local manipulation detectors on various inpainting datasets derived from different generative models, showing a 12% higher IoU on average.

**Conclusion:** DinoLizer demonstrates strong representational power and robustness when localizing deepfakes, even after post-processing, and comparative studies with DINOv3 affirm its effectiveness.

**Abstract:** We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 由于没有现有的基准可以评估视觉语言模型在基于工具的设计性能上的表现，本文提出CANVAS作为填补这一空白的解决方案。这有助于理解VLMs与设计师协作的潜力。

**Method:** 本文介绍了一个针对基于工具的用户界面设计的评估基准CANVAS，包含598个设计任务，这些任务来源于30种类别的移动UI设计，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的设计能力。CANVAS包括两种任务类型：复制整个UI屏幕和修改现有屏幕的特定部分。

**Result:** 研究表明，顶尖模型在进行策略性工具调用以提高设计质量方面表现突出。此外，还识别出了模型常出现的错误模式，为进一步提升基于工具的设计能力提供了指导。

**Conclusion:** 本文提出了CANVAS作为评估视觉语言模型的工具基础用户界面设计能力的基准，并展示了顶尖模型具有重要的设计改进潜力。

**Abstract:** User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 传统方法独立预训练图像编码器，这导致编码器在处理图像时忽视了具体的下游任务或文本查询，该研究旨在解决这一局限。

**Method:** 本研究提出了一种名为文本引导的语义图像编码器（TIE）的新方法，该方法可以根据输入的文本查询生成图像表示。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，配备TIE的视觉-语言模型在九个图像到文本基准测试上的平均性能提高了1.5到1.3个百分点，在某些任务上最高提升了6个百分点，同时使用较少的图像块（token）提升了推断效率。

**Conclusion:** 研究结论表明，基于TIE的模型不仅表现优异，而且与常规模型相比更加高效，同时在解释性和查询相关性方面有所提升。

**Abstract:** Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

**Abstract:** Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 研究动机是解决大型多模态模型在处理长视频时的幻觉问题，即当证据稀缺且分散时推理能力的不足。

**Method:** 通过结合大型多模态模型（LMMs）的时空锁定能力作为视频剪辑工具，LongVT框架实现了从全局到局部的推理循环，以解决长视频理解中的幻觉问题。

**Result:** LongVT在四个具有挑战性的长视频理解和推理基准测试中，持续超越现有强基线。

**Conclusion:** LongVT的研究表明，通过巧妙设计的训练策略和丰富的实验验证，可以显著提高长视频理解的能力。

**Abstract:** Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

**Motivation:** 尽管KRISP在视觉-语言推理中引入结构化外部知识方面表现出色，但原始模型针对工业规模训练，计算需求高且依赖大型后备架构。因此，论文的目标是提供一个轻量级复制版本，以探讨资源受限条件下的应用问题。

**Method:** 该论文从不同角度重新审视了KRISP，并提供了一个参数显著更少的轻量化版本。通过系统消融研究，包括在合成VQA数据上的概念验证和DAQUAR数据集上的评估，探讨了资源受限条件下知识增强的VQA架构的扩展性和有效性。

**Result:** 轻量级复制模型在性能上约为原始模型的75%，揭示了设计缺陷、实际问题和原论文未充分覆盖的隐性问题。该模型配置了低参数设置，并受限于外部知识图域，防止了AI幻觉，生成的输出仅限于该领域。

**Conclusion:** 轻量化模型不仅展示了在资源受限条件下的应用潜力，如智能手机和AR-VR设备上的离线视觉推理，还防止了AI幻觉并生成了可靠输出。

**Abstract:** Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

**Motivation:** 尽管计算机视觉模型中动态采样机制在深度学习架构中展示了广泛的应用效用，相关的理论分析仍未统一。本研究的动机在于提供一种统一的分析框架，以便深入理解动态采样机制的影响。

**Method:** 本研究通过发展一种被称为“warping（变形）”的操作符来概括现有的动态采样方法，进而连接不同动态采样机制。warping操作符被认为是最小化的动态采样实现，能用于重构现有架构，包括可变形卷积、激活卷积单元和空间变换网络。同时，通过对输入为独立同分布变量和同质随机场的情形提供统计分析，进一步探讨该操作符。

**Conclusion:** 研究引入了一种新的损失景观可视化方法，可以直接利用梯度更新信息来更好地理解学习行为。此外，还研究了离散化效果的统计分析。

**Abstract:** Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 神经辐射场（NeRFs）在3D重建和新视图合成方面显示出强大的能力，但大多数现有框架在引入新视图时需要完整重新训练，这对数据序列化到达的领域，如基于卫星的地形分析，构成了限制。同时，NeRFs的增量式细化较少被探索，并且普通的增量式调整方法在没有过去数据的情况下容易导致灾难性遗忘。

**Method:** 该论文提出了$\Delta$-NeRF，一种用于增量式NeRF调整的独特模块化残差框架。它包括三项新技术：1）残差控制器在冻结的基线NeRF的每层中加入修正，实现了无需访问过去数据的改进；2）不确定性感知门控机制，通过自适应地组合基线预测和改进预测防止过度修正；3）视图选择策略，减少训练数据但保持性能。此外，该方法使用知识蒸馏将增强模型压缩成一个紧凑的学生网络，尺寸仅为原始网络的20%。

**Result:** 实验表明，$\Delta$-NeRF与联合训练性能相当，但训练时间减少了30-42%。在卫星图像上，$\Delta$-NeRF持续超越现有基线，比原始微调提高了最多43.5%的PSNR，并在某些指标上优于联合训练。

**Conclusion:** 该研究展示了$\Delta$-NeRF在实现增量式NeRF调整方面的能力，通过减少训练数据和时间同时保持甚至提升性能，为3D场景的动态更新提供了一种创新的策略。

**Abstract:** Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

> Split-then-Merge (StM) is a new framework for generative video composition that splits unlabeled videos into foreground and background layers, allowing the model to learn compositional dynamics without relying on annotated datasets. This method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation for the StM framework is to provide more control over generative video compositions while addressing the data scarcity issue that exists with traditional methods that depend on annotated datasets or hand-crafted rules.

**Method:** StM splits a large collection of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, enabling self-composition of these elements to learn interactions and dynamics. It features a transformation-aware training pipeline with a multi-layer fusion and augmentation process, as well as an identity-preservation loss to maintain foreground details during the blending process.

**Result:** The results indicate that the StM framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative benchmark tests and in human/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

**Conclusion:** The Split-then-Merge (StM) framework successfully enhances generative video composition by learning from unlabeled video data and provides a viable solution to the problem of limited annotated video datasets. It demonstrates strong performance in generating realistic videos.

**Abstract:** We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

**Method:** Sphinx is a synthetic environment for generating puzzles that target core cognitive primitives such as symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction.

**Result:** Evaluation of large vision-language models (LVLMs) showed that even the state-of-the-art GPT-5 only reached 51.1% accuracy on these tasks. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improved model accuracy and performance on external visual reasoning benchmarks.

**Conclusion:** This work highlights the need for advancements in multimodal reasoning and demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in improving the performance of visual reasoning models.

**Abstract:** We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

**Motivation:** 挑战使用训练好的视觉先验网络的需求，提出一种无需训练和数据的视觉逆向优化方法，提高生成图像的质量同时降低成本。

**Method:** 采取优化视觉逆向(OVI)方法，即从随机伪标记中初始化潜视觉表示，并通过迭代优化以最大化与输入文本嵌入的余弦相似性，同时引入马氏距离和最近邻损失两种损失函数作为约束，以规范该优化过程。

**Result:** 实验在Kandinsky 2.2上显示，优化后的OVI方法能够替代传统的视觉先验方法。尤其最近邻方法显著提高了图像感知质量，有望成为新基准。

**Conclusion:** 文章结果表明OVI方法能够在没有训练数据的情况下产生具有高视觉保真度的图像，开辟了文字转图像生成领域的新方向，并指出当前评价基准存在误导。

**Abstract:** Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

> 提出RefTr模型用于3D图像中血管树中心线的生成，该模型使用递归精炼策略生成拓扑结构正确的中心线图，达到了更好召回率和相当精度，同时更少参数和更快推理时间。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 准确地检测血管树中心线及其正确的树形拓扑结构对于临床任务如诊断、治疗规划和手术导航至关重要。特别是在这些应用中，保持高召回率非常重要，因为遗漏小分支可能导致由于评估不完整或未检测到的异常而导致致命错误。

**Method:** RefTr采用了一种3D图像到图模型，用于生成血管树的中心线，该模型通过递归精炼汇聚轨迹来实现。该架构包含一个生产者-精炼者结构，基于Transformer解码器，生产者提出了一组初始汇聚轨迹，然后精炼者递归地精炼这些轨迹以生成最终的轨迹，这些轨迹构成了中心线图。汇聚轨迹表示使我们能够细化完整的轨迹，同时明确地强制执行有效的树拓扑结构。递归精炼方案提高了精度，并重用了多个步骤中的相同精炼器块，与之前的最先进技术相比，解码器参数减少了2.4倍。

**Result:** RefTr在多个公共中心线数据集上实现了优于以往最先进技术的召回率，并且精度相当，同时提供了更快的推理速度和更少的参数，展示了其作为3D医学影像中血管树分析新最先进技术框架的潜力。

**Conclusion:** 综上所述，RefTr展示了作为一个可靠的血管树中心线检测器的潜力，它在保留高召回率的同时提高了精度，并且由于其高效的设计，可以更快地执行，并且需要更少的计算资源。

**Abstract:** Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

**Motivation:** 由于缺乏大规模、高保真的真实立体DSLR数据集，当前深度估计和景深渲染的研究在真实世界中的应用和评估受到了极大的限制。

**Method:** 本研究构建了首个高分辨率(5472×3648px)立体DSLR数据集，包含18000张图像，系统性地变化了焦距和光圈，在复杂的真实场景中捕捉了专业相机系统的光学真实性和复杂性。

**Result:** 数据集覆盖了全部的光学配置，支持对单目和立体深度估计、浅景深渲染、去模糊、三维场景重建和新视角合成的几何和光学效应的控制分析。

**Conclusion:** 该数据集将合成训练数据与真实相机光学之间的现实差距缩小，并揭示了当前最先进的单目、立体深度和景深方法存在的挑战。

**Abstract:** Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

**Method:** 通过从Reddit等在线平台收集tip-of-the-tongue (ToT)检索查询来构建一个包含超过82,000个视频的大型无监督数据集，以提供丰富的记忆信号。

**Result:** 大规模无监督数据集为记忆相关的两项任务——记忆生成和ToT检索——提供了丰富信号。在该数据集上进行微调的大型视觉-语言模型，在生成视觉内容的记忆描述方面超过了最先进的GPT-4o模型。

**Conclusion:** 该数据集和模型为视觉内容记忆研究提供了一个新的研究方向。

**Abstract:** Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

**Motivation:** 为了解决现有方法中分别估计参数易导致误差累积问题，同时处理全局非均匀的现实世界雾，以及提供一个新的数据集来评估该类方法。

**Method:** Structure

**Result:** 通过在合成数据和新数据集SDIRF上进行的广泛实验，证明了提出的方法不仅可以更准确地估计合成数据中的参数，而且对现实中的雾有更好的适应性。

**Conclusion:** 该方法可以作为一种附加模块使用于现存在雾情况下的视觉定位与地图构建或里程计系统中，同时提供的新数据集SDIRF增强了研究者对此领域研究的能力。

**Abstract:** We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的分割模型难以直接应用于解决由于视角和外观差异带来的显著挑战——跨视角对象对应问题。

**Method:** 通过两个补充的提示生成器将SAM2从单视角分割适应到跨视角对应，即基于DINOv3特征的跨视角锚点提示生成器（V^2-Anchor）和用于增强外观指导线索的跨视角视觉提示生成器（V^2-Visual）。V^2-SAM还采用了多专家设计以及基于循环一致性的动态专家选择器（PCCS）。

**Result:** 在Ego-Exo4D（跨视角对象对应）、DAVIS-2017（视频对象跟踪）和HANDAL-X（机器人准备跨视角对应）数据集上实现了新的最先进的性能。

**Conclusion:** 实验表明，V^2-SAM在跨视角对象对应任务上达到了新的状态水平。

**Abstract:** Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的方法倾向于在对齐特定奖励方面表现出欠优或过度优化的问题，因此提出一种新的对齐方法来解决这些问题。

**Method:** 提出Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA)，通过优化无条件嵌入的分类器自由引导而非操纵潜在或噪声变量来对齐扩散模型。

**Result:** Null-TTA 实现了最先进的目标测试时间对齐，同时保持了强大的跨奖励泛化能力。

**Conclusion:** Text embedding space的结构化语义性质确保了对齐在语义连贯的流形上发生，而无需更新模型参数，直接调整模型的生成分布。

**Abstract:** Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 解决传统INR在动态或交互场景下因缺乏显式几何结构和局部编辑能力而受限的问题。

**Method:** GaINeR通过整合K个最近邻的高斯分布，并通过神经网络预测RGB值来表示连续图像，实现可解释的几何结构和灵活的局部编辑。

**Result:** 该方法提供了物理感知和交互式图像处理的基础。

**Conclusion:** GaINeR框架展示了连续图像表示，解释型几何结构和灵活的局部编辑能力，适用于物理感知和交互式图像处理。

**Abstract:** Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

**Motivation:** Error

**Conclusion:** Error

**Abstract:** Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 该技术旨在通过促进模型中的时间归纳偏置，尤其是在轻量级架构中，从而提高视频识别模型的性能。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种平滑正则化技术，该技术通过建模连续帧中间层嵌入的变化来鼓励平稳性，这种变化被视为高斯随机游走（GRW）。这种方法通过监督突变表示的转换，从而促进了低加速解决方案，这些解决方案更符合视频中内在的自然时间一致性。

**Result:** 应用该技术到轻量级模型上时，与先前的最先进模型相比，准确率提高了3.8%到6.4%。MoViNets模型族、MobileNetV3和MoViNets-Stream模型族分别实现了3.8%至6.1%和4.9%至6.4%的性能提升。

**Conclusion:** 所提出的技术在不增加模型参数的情况下提高了轻量级模型在视频识别任务中的性能，并提升了相关模型族在FLOP限制下的准确性。

**Abstract:** We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

**Abstract:** Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation is to improve upon the time-consuming and imprecise manual method of measuring tree-ring growth by providing a dataset that allows for the development and evaluation of automatic measurement techniques.

**Method:** The paper addresses the challenge of manual measurement of tree-ring growth by introducing UruDendro4, a new dataset of 102 annotated images of Pine trees, enabling volumetric modeling of annual growth. It also benchmarks the performance of automatic ring detection methods using the UruDendro4 dataset.

**Result:** The study shows that the DeepCS-TRD method exhibits the highest performance for automatic ring detection on the UruDendro4 dataset, and also shows improvement in model generalization.

**Conclusion:** The research demonstrates that DeepCS-TRD achieves the best performance among the tested methods on the UruDendro4 dataset for automatic detection of tree rings with a significant improvement in the generalization ability of learning models.

**Abstract:** Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

**Motivation:** 受缺乏图像-报告配对数据集和大型语言模型幻觉风险的影响，本研究旨在设计一种无需成对图像-报告监督的乳腺超声放射报告生成方法。

**Method:** 我们提出了BUSTR，这是一种多任务视觉语言框架，它可以从结构化描述符和放射组学特征中构建报告，并通过一个多头Swin编码器学习描述符感知的视觉表示。此外，它通过结合标记级别交叉熵和输入输出表示之间的余弦相似性对齐损失来对齐视觉和文本令牌。

**Result:** 在两个数据集BrEaST和BUS-BRA上，实验结果表明，BUSTR在标准自然语言生成度量和临床有效性度量方面表现出更优的表现，特别是在BI-RADS类别和病理方面。

**Conclusion:** 研究结果表明，通过与组合标记级别和对齐损失一起训练的描述符感知视觉模型，在不使用成对图像-报告数据的情况下提升了自动报告生成指标和临床有效性。

**Abstract:** Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

*Haoming Lu,David Kocharian,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

> 本文提出了一种新的图像组合形式—具有多样化的风格和更灵活的安排逻辑的表达组合任务，并提出了StickerNet模型，它基于大量真实的用户编辑行为数据训练，不仅能超越基线方法，而且接近人类的放置行为。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 鉴于在现实创作平台上用户创建的内容更多样化，不再局限于保持视觉真实感，而是更注重艺术性、趣味性或社会互动。

**Method:** StickerNet采用两阶段框架，首先确定图像组合类型，然后预测诸如不透明度、蒙版、位置和尺度等放置参数。

**Result:** 通过用户研究和定量评估显示，StickerNet超越了常见的基线方法，并且在很大程度上匹配了人类的放置行为。

**Conclusion:** 这项工作引入了一种新的视觉理解方向，强调表达性及用户意图而非现实性。

**Abstract:** As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

> 本文介绍了一种名为TrafficLens的算法，专门处理交通摄像头视频数据，能有效减少视频到文本转换时间，提升交通视频分析效率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本任务上表现出色，但将它们整合到交通视频分析中需要将视频数据转化为文本，这一过程非常耗时。TrafficLens旨在解决这一挑战，以提高交通视频分析的效率和及时性。

**Method:** TrafficLens是一种专门为多摄像头交通交叉口设计的算法。它采用顺序方法，通过利用摄像头的重叠覆盖区域，逐步应用具有不同令牌限制的视觉语言模型（VLM），并将先前的输出作为后续摄像头的提示。此外，通过对象级相似性检测器智能地绕过冗余的VLM调用。

**Result:** 实验结果显示，TrafficLens将视频到文本的转换时间减少了多达4倍，同时保持信息准确性。

**Conclusion:** TrafficLens通过减少视频到文本转换时间并提高分析效率，为多摄像头交通交叉口提供了一种有效的解决方案。实验结果证实了其性能和准确性。

**Abstract:** Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

### [68] [Privacy-Preserving Federated Vision Transformer Learning Leveraging Lightweight Homomorphic Encryption in Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20983)
*Al Amin,Kamrul Hasan,Liang Hong,Sharif Ullah*

Main category: cs.CV

> This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning method for histopathology that uses Vision Transformers and homomorphic encryption to protect CLS tokens, reducing communication requirements and preventing sensitive information exposure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this research is to enhance privacy in federated learning by presenting a solution that reduces the vulnerability of model gradients to reconstruction attacks, thus protecting sensitive medical information. The solution aims at maintaining high diagnostic accuracy while complying with privacy regulations such as HIPAA.

**Method:** This paper introduces a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for histopathology classification that uses Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE). It focuses on the secure aggregation of the CLS token as a 768-dimensional feature representation and encrypts these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption for transmission.

**Result:** The proposed method achieves a 30-fold reduction in communication requirements compared to gradient encryption, demonstrating robust privacy guarantees. It successfully prevents model inversion attacks as shown by the near-perfect image reconstruction from gradients (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741) but not from the protected CLS tokens.

**Conclusion:** The paper concludes that the CLS-token protected approach with homomorphic encryption is effective in securing federated learning, reducing communication overhead, and maintaining diagnostic accuracy. It achieves above 90% classification accuracy even when the CLS tokens are encrypted, making it a viable option for multi-institutional collaborations in healthcare.

**Abstract:** Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

> 提出了一种无逆向过程的基于双校正流的风格迁移框架，通过前向传递预测并融合内容与风格轨迹，解决了现有方法效率低和视觉失真的问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的扩散模型在风格迁移中依赖于计算繁重的逆向过程，这不仅效率低下，而且在逆向处理不准确时会引起视觉失真。为解决这些问题，提出了无需逆向过程的新框架。

**Method:** 采用双校正流框架，通过动态中间点插值并行预测内容和风格轨迹，并融合这两条轨迹的学习速度，同时通过注意力机制来引导风格集成，提高视觉保真度和计算效率。

**Result:** 实验展示了框架在多样化风格和内容间的一般适用性，证明了其在风格迁移中的有效性和效率。

**Conclusion:** 该方法提供了一个新颖且有效的风格迁移框架，能够在无需逆向过程的前提下完成高质量的风格迁移任务。

**Abstract:** Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

### [70] [RefOnce: Distilling References into a Prototype Memory for Referring Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20989)
*Yu-Huan Wu,Zi-Xuan Zhu,Yan Wang,Liangli Zhen,Deng-Ping Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

> 提出了一种新的Ref-COD方法，该方法在训练时将参考图像蒸馏成类别原型，并在测试时不依赖于参考图像而生成参考向量。通过这种方法，在不使用参考图像的情况下实现了竞争性或优于当前最先进方法的表现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Motivation:** 现有的Ref-COD系统往往采用双分支设计，需要在测试时使用参考图像，这限制了方法的部署性，并增加了延迟和数据采集的负担。因此，我们提出了一个无需参考图像的Ref-COD框架，以解决这一问题并提高效率。

**Method:** 我们提出了一种Ref-COD框架，该框架通过在训练时将参考图像蒸馏成类别原型记忆，并在推理过程中根据查询条件合成参考向量来实现。具体来说，我们为每个类别维护了一个通过EMA更新的原型，并从查询中预测混合权重来生成指导向量，从而在测试时不使用任何参考图像。为了弥合参考统计和伪装查询特征之间的表示差距，我们提出了一种双向注意力对齐模块，该模块可以适应查询特征和类别表示。

**Result:** 我们在大规模的R2C7K基准上评估了所提出的方法。大量实验表明，所提出的方法与最近的最先进技术相比具有竞争力或优越的表现。代码可以在https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce获取。

**Conclusion:** 我们的方法为Ref-COD提供了一条简单高效的路径，摆脱了在测试时需要参考图像的限制，提高了部署的灵活性，减少了输入数据的负担。

**Abstract:** Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.
