提出了首个电信运营调度评估基准TeleEval-OS，评估了开源和闭源大型语言模型在该领域的表现，发现开源模型在某些场景下表现优于闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电信运营调度领域因任务复杂、专业性强且缺乏全面的评估基准，限制了大型语言模型的应用潜力。

Method: 创建了包含15个数据集和13个子任务的TeleEval-OS基准，分为四个关键运营阶段进行仿真，并使用零样本和少样本评估方法来评测14个大型语言模型。

Result: 实验结果表明在某些场景下开源大型语言模型的表现优于闭源模型。

Conclusion: 开源语言模型在电信运营调度领域展现出了显著的潜力和价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

本文首次全面研究了多模态RAG系统中的位置偏差，引入了一个新的指数$PSI_p$，并开发了对应的可视化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着检索复杂性的增加，确保这些系统的稳健性至关重要。然而，目前的RAG模型对呈现证据的顺序非常敏感，通常会导致不稳定的表现和偏差推理，特别是在检索到的项目数量或模式多样性增加时。这提出了一个问题：检索证据的位置如何影响多模态RAG性能？

Method: 通过在仅文本、仅图像和多模态任务上进行控制实验，本文观察到一个关于证据位置的一致U型准确性曲线。为了量化这种偏差，本文引入了位置敏感度指数($PSI_p$) 并开发了可视化框架来追踪解码器各层中的注意力分配模式。

Result: 研究结果揭示，多模态互动相比单一模态设置，增强了位置偏差，并且这种偏差随着检索范围的增加而对数增长。

Conclusion: 这些研究结果为RAG中的位置感知分析提供了理论和实证基础，强调了为了构建更可靠和公平的生成系统，需要进行证据重新排序或去偏差策略的必要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

Method: {immerse}通过使用现存文学作品中的数据，构建了Russenorsk的结构化词典。并利用大型语言模型提出关于该语言形成法则的假设。

Result: {immerse}分析了使用现代大型语言模型(LLM)通过现存的文学资料对俄挪贸易用语Russenorsk的词汇进行分析的方法。构建了一个按同义词和词源分类的结构化词典，并以此为基础提出关于Russenorsk词形成和句法结构的核心原则的假设。还开发了一种“重建”翻译代理，用于生成当代俄语和挪威语文本的假设俄挪贸易用语版本。

Conclusion: {immerse}通过研究验证了大型语言模型在重建和理解失传语言方面的潜力。

Abstract: Russenorsk, a pidgin language historically used in trade interactions between
Russian and Norwegian speakers, represents a unique linguistic phenomenon. In
this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language
models (LLMs), based on surviving literary sources. We construct a structured
dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk
renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts.

开发了一种使用大语言模型的管道来从临床笔记中自动提取审查系统（ROS）实体，以实现成本效益和可扩展性的提升，开源大语言模型在性能上表现出不错的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是开发出一个成本低且基于大语言模型的管道，用于从临床笔记中自动提取Review of Systems (ROS)实体，以减轻ROS文档记录负担。

Method: 利用开源大语言模型（如Mistral, Llama, Gemma）和ChatGPT进行审查系统（ROS）实体的自动提取，通过SecTag提取ROS部分，然后用few-shot大语言模型来识别实体跨度、正负状态及对应的身体系统。

Result: 在36份内科病历（包含341个注释的ROS实体）中，集成ChatGPT的管道在发现ROS实体跨度和其相应正负状态或系统方面达到了最低误差率（28.2%和14.5%）。开源大语言模型提供了本地执行且成本效益高的方案，并且具有同样较低的误差率（跨度误差：30.5-36.7%，状态/系统误差：24.3-27.3%）。

Conclusion: 研究开发的管道作为一个可扩展并能本地部署的解决方案，有助于减少ROS文档记录的工作负担。开源大语言模型为资源有限的医疗环境提供了一种可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Objective: Develop a cost-effective, large language model (LLM)-based
pipeline for automatically extracting Review of Systems (ROS) entities from
clinical notes. Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using
SecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their
positive/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the
pipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The
evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:
24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and
locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source
LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited
healthcare environments.

### [5] [Deontological Keyword Bias: The Impact of Modal Expressions on Normative Judgments of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11068)
*Bumjin Park,Jinsil Lee,Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

本研究揭示了大语言模型在处理包含义务相关模态表达的情境时，存在显著的误判倾向，称之为“义务关键词偏见”（DKB）。建议通过结合少量示例和推理提示的方法来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地参与道德和伦理推理，判断标准往往不明确，甚至对人类来说也是如此。研究发现，特别是在评估义务判断方面，大语言模型对包含如“必须”或“应当”等模态表达的情境有强烈偏见。

Method: 本研究通过引入“义务关键词偏见”（DKB）现象来检验大语言模型在面对模态表达时，如何将非义务情境误判为义务。研究中采用了几种大语言模型，并采用了不同的问题类型和答案格式。为了缓解DKB，提出了一个结合少量示例和推理提示的判断策略。

Result: 研究结果表明，当提示中包含模态表达时，大语言模型会将超过90%的常识情境误判为义务，这种倾向在不同大语言模型家族、问题类型和答案格式中是一致的。

Conclusion: 研究强调了模态表达作为一种语言框架如何影响大语言模型的规范决策过程，并指出了纠正此类偏见的重要性，以确保决策的准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

### [6] [Targeted control of fast prototyping through domain-specific interface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11070)
*Yu-Zhe Shi,Mingchen Liu,Hanlu Ma,Qiao Xu,Huamin Qu,Kun He,Lecheng Ruan,Qining Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

本文提出了一种新型接口架构，旨在桥接设计者语言与建模语言之间的差距，通过自动领域规范的算法实现快速原型制作中的精准定向控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业设计师一直希望有一种自然且直观的方式来实现原型模型的定向控制，通过简单的自然语言指令无缝地配置和调整模型，而不是依赖复杂的建模命令。而大型语言模型在这一方向上展现了潜力，但仍未能充分利用。其限制源于设计语言与建模语言之间的差距，包括抽象级别、语义精度和词彚范围等方面的差异。

Method: 提出了一种作为设计者语言与建模语言之间媒介的接口架构，并制定了自动领域规范的算法。这一架构的设计原则源自快速原型制作实践的系统调查。

Result: 基于机器评估和人类研究中的快速原型制作测试揭示了该接口作为大型语言模型的辅助模块的潜力，能够精准、有效地控制原型模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果证明了所提出的接口架构作为辅助模块，与大型语言模型结合使用时能够实现对原型模型的精准而有效的控制。

Abstract: Industrial designers have long sought a natural and intuitive way to achieve
the targeted control of prototype models -- using simple natural language
instructions to configure and adjust the models seamlessly according to their
intentions, without relying on complex modeling commands. While Large Language
Models have shown promise in this area, their potential for controlling
prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

### [7] [CLAIM: Mitigating Multilingual Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models with Cross-Lingual Attention Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11073)
*Zekai Ye,Qiming Li,Xiaocheng Feng,Libo Qin,Yichong Huang,Baohang Li,Kui Jiang,Yang Xiang,Zhirui Zhang,Yunfei Lu,Duyu Tang,Dandan Tu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

本文提出了CLAIM方法，一种几乎不需要重新训练的跨语言注意力干预策略，用于减少视觉语言模型在多语言环境中的幻觉现象，实验表明该方法显著提升了模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究的动机在于解决视觉语言模型在处理非英语查询时，相较于英语查询更易产生与视觉输入不一致的回应这一问题。现有解决方法依赖预训练或微调，资源消耗大。

Method: CLAIM方法通过校正跨模态注意力模式来缓解多语言环境下的视觉语言模型(HVLM)的幻觉问题。该方法首先识别特定语言的跨模态注意力头，然后计算从英语到目标语言的注意力转换向量，并在推理过程中干预注意力输出，以促进跨语言间的视觉感知能力对齐。

Result: 实验结果显示，相比现有方法，CLAIM方法在POPE和MME基准测试的幻觉子集上实现了平均13.56%（在西班牙语上的改进高达30%）和21.75%的显著提升。

Conclusion: 研究结论是，通过调整中间层的注意力模式可以有效减少多语言环境下的幻觉现象，从而提升视觉语言模型的跨语言视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

本文研究了反射标记对大推理模型性能的影响，并提出了一种新的解码策略CyclicReflex，以优化该过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过自适应调整反思标记的频率和位置来提高大推理模型的测试时计算性能。

Method: 通过实证分析，研究了过度反思（过量使用反思标记）和不足反思（不足使用反思标记）对模型性能的影响，并提出了一种名为CyclicReflex的解码策略，该策略使用依赖位置的三角波动态调整反思标记的使用。

Result: 实验表明，对于不同规模的模型（1.5B-8B），CyclicReflex可以显著提高性能，优于标准解码和其他方法（如TIP和S1）。

Conclusion: 这是一种有效的策略，可以作为优化多步推理模型性能的一个手段。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at
https://github.com/OPTML-Group/CyclicReflex.

*Yuzhou Yang,Yangming Zhou,Zhiying Zhu,Zhenxing Qian,Xinpeng Zhang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

本文介绍了一种新的假新闻检测框架RoE-FND，通过结合大型语言模型和经验学习来解决现有方法的挑战，实现了更好的泛化能力和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线虚假内容的泛滥需要强大的假新闻检测系统。然而，现有的基于证据的方法存在噪声证据选择、泛化瓶颈和决策过程不透明等关键限制。近年来，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行假新闻检测的努力提出了新的挑战，包括虚构的理由和结论偏差。

Method: 本文提出了RoE-FND框架，该框架重新定义了基于证据的假新闻检测为逻辑演绎任务。RoE-FND包括两个阶段：1) 自我反思知识构建，即通过分析过去的推理错误来建立知识库的探索阶段；2) 动态标准检索，即在部署过程中从历史案例中合成特定任务的推理指南。此外，通过设计的双通道程序来交叉验证推理。

Result: 本文提出的方法能够适应不断变化的情况，并提供了超越当前最先进方法的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在三个数据集上进行了实证验证，证明了其在泛化能力和有效性方面的优越性。

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across
three datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

本文介绍了一种用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）多模态能力的双语基准MANBench。该基准被设计为用于比较人类和MLLMs之间的性能差异，研究结果显示尽管MLLMs在知识理解和文本图像理解方面表现出色，但在复杂多模态任务中仍远远不及人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的快速发展，它们在多模态任务中超越人类性能的可能性引发了讨论。为回应这一趋势，本文旨在通过多模态任务评估框架，研究并对比人类与MLLMs的多模态能力差异。

Method: 本文介绍了MANBench（多模态能力规范基准），这是一个涵盖9个任务、包括1,314个问题的双语（英语和中文）多模态任务评估框架。该基准强调直观推理、无缝跨模态集成和现实世界复杂性，并通过广泛的实验比较了人类和最先进的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的性能。

Result: 通过涉及不同参与者的广泛人类实验，结果表明，尽管多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在一些任务（如知识理解与文本图像理解）中表现优异，但对于需要深入跨模态推理的任务（如转换理解、图像一致性和多重图像理解），MLLMs的能力仍然不足。同时，无论是人类还是MLLMs，在处理复杂任务（如谜题和空间想象力）时都面临一定的挑战。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，尽管MLLMs在诸如知识理解和文本图像理解等任务中表现出色，但在需要跨模态深度推理的任务上，如转换理解、图像一致性和多图像理解，他们表现不佳。另外，人类和MLLMs在解决复杂任务如拼图和空间想象中都面临挑战。MANBench揭示了MLLMs的优势与不足，并指出即便是先进的模型也未能在许多领域达到人类水平的表现，旨在激励研究者们努力缩小MLLMs和人类多模态能力的差距。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has ignited
discussions regarding their potential to surpass human performance in
multimodal tasks. In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms
Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/micdz/MANBench.

Main category: cs.CL

The paper introduces SAGE, a method for generating Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) using reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning of large language models, showing significant improvements in grammar validity and test effectiveness for competitive programming problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating valid and general grammars from natural language specifications under limited supervision for competitive programming problems.

Method: Grammar-based test case generation using open-source large language models (LLMs) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for inducing Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs).

Result: The approach, named SAGE, demonstrates superior generalization and outperforms 17 other LLMs in grammar quality and test effectiveness, showing significant improvements in grammar validity and test effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study concludes that leveraging fine-tuned open-source LLMs and reinforcement learning improves the generation of effective grammars from specifications, leading to improved test case generation in competitive programming.

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our
implementation and dataset at the following anonymous

PRISM，一种用于预测临床决策过程顺序进展的变压器模型，展示了在预测下一个事件时相比于随机基线的显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与依赖孤立诊断分类的传统方法不同，PRISM使用自回归训练目标和大型定制临床词汇表，能够捕捉跨越纵向患者时间线索的复杂依赖关系。

Method: 引入了基于变压器架构的PRISM模型，用于模拟临床决策过程的顺序进展。PRISM将临床轨迹视为包括诊断测试、实验室结果和诊断事件的标记序列，并学习预测患者诊断旅程中下一步最可能发生的事件。

Result: 实验结果表明，在下一个标记预测任务上，PRISM相比于随机基线有了显著提升，生成序列反映了实际的诊断路径、实验室结果进展和临床医生的操作习惯。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了将生成语言建模技术应用于结构化医疗事件数据中的可行性，开启了临床决策支持、模拟和教育的新应用。PRISM为未来的基于序列的健康管理模型奠定了基础，缩小了机器学习框架与现实世界诊断推理之间的差距。

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

文章通过分析大语言模型中的激活空间，发现可信度和忠实度幻觉共享神经表征子空间，提出SPACE框架来同时缓解这两种问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有的方法分别解决了这两种幻觉类型，但它们可能会无意中引起性能权衡。当前方法对一种类型的干预往往会加剧另一种类型的幻觉问题。

Method: 通过激活空间动力学的实证和理论分析，揭示了在大语言模型中，这些幻觉类别在神经表征中共享重叠子空间，提供了一个同时减轻两种幻觉的机会。提出了一种统一框架SPACE，通过编辑共享激活子空间来同时提升可信度和忠实度。SPACE通过双任务特征建模建立共享子空间存在的几何基础，然后通过结合谱聚类和注意力得分识别并编辑这些子空间。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果证明了我们方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 实验结果证明了SPACE框架在提升大语言模型的可信度和忠实度方面的有效性。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

提出了一种通过引入大型语言模型作为奖励模型的强化学习框架，提升自动语音识别系统在命名实体识别和领域自适应上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动语音识别系统在一般转录任务上表现良好，但在识别罕见命名实体和应对领域不匹配上仍有困难。相比之下，通过大规模互联网数据训练的大语言模型在广泛领域的表现更佳。

Method: 采用了一种基于强化学习的无监督领域自适应方法，利用未标记的数据通过大型语言模型（LLM）的反馈来提升转录质量，特别是受领域不匹配影响的命名实体的识别。该框架使用LLM作为奖励模型，对ASR模型的假设进行评分，这些评分作为奖励信号用于通过强化学习微调ASR模型。

Result: 相比于传统的自训练方法，该方法在实体单词错误率上提高了21%。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的方法证明了使用强化学习和大型语言模型作为奖励模型，可以显著提升自动语音识别系统在特定领域的转录准确性。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

本文提出了动态上下文调优（DCT）框架，以支持多轮次对话和不断变化的工具环境，无需重新训练。实验结果显示DCT在提高计划准确性、减少幻觉以及成本效益方面均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成（RAG）系统通常受到静态、单轮次交互和固定工具集的限制，不适用于意图、可用工具和环境因素随着时间演变的动态领域，比如医疗保健和智能家居。

Method: 提出了动态上下文调优（DCT）框架，该框架集成了基于注意力的上下文缓存来追踪相关的历史信息，基于LoRA的检索来动态选择领域特定工具，以及高效的上下文压缩来维持输入在语言模型的上下文限制内。

Result: 实验结果显示DCT提升了计划的准确性14%，降低了幻觉37%，并能在不使用高昂成本的情况下匹敌GPT-4的表现。

Conclusion: DCT能够适应之前未见过的工具，提供可扩展和适应性强的AI助手，适用于各种动态环境。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

Motivation: { to address the high resource demand of hybrid CV models and enable practical edge deployment }

Method: { using structure-aware post-training quantization (EfficientQuant) that applies uniform quantization to convolutional blocks and \$log_2\$ quantization to transformer blocks }

Result: { efficiency improvement on hybrid models by applying novel quantization method, achieving significant latency reduction with minimal accuracy loss, suitable for edge devices }

Conclusion: { EfficientQuant is effective for reducing resource consumption in hybrid models, suitable for edge deployment }

Abstract: Hybrid models that combine convolutional and transformer blocks offer strong
performance in computer vision (CV) tasks but are resource-intensive for edge
deployment. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) can help reduce resource
demand, its application to hybrid models remains limited. We propose
EfficientQuant, a novel structure-aware PTQ approach that applies uniform
quantization to convolutional blocks and $log_2$ quantization to transformer
blocks. EfficientQuant achieves $2.5 \times - 8.7 \times$ latency reduction
with minimal accuracy loss on the ImageNet-1K dataset. It further demonstrates
low latency and memory efficiency on edge devices, making it practical for
real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 该研究框架为图像质量变化或受限的应用场景提供了解决方案，实现了图像质量提升与高效目标检测之间的平衡，使目标检测在具有挑战性的场景中变得更加可靠和稳健。

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the

solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves
a balance between improved image quality and efficient object detection

The paper proposes improvements to the RefAV framework for better scenario mining in autonomous driving datasets by using a fault-tolerant iterative code generation and specialized prompt engineering, resulting in significant improvements in precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges faced by the RefAV framework, such as runtime errors from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in parameter interpretation for complex multi-object spatial relationships, for the reliable and accurate scenario mining from autonomous driving datasets like Argoverse 2.

Method: The paper introduces two key enhancements to the RefAV framework: a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation mechanism for refining code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback and specialized prompt engineering for better understanding and application of spatial-relationship functions.

Result: Experiments on the Argoverse 2 validation set with various LLMs show consistent gains across multiple metrics, with the system achieving a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements effectively improve the reliability and precision of scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, suggesting a viable path for the development and validation of self-driving systems.

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official
test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro. These results underline the efficacy of the
proposed techniques for reliable, high-precision scenario mining.

*Artem Solomko,Oleg Kartashev,Andrey Golov,Mikhail Deulin,Vadim Valynkin,Vasily Kharin*

Main category: cs.CV

A novel StarDist-based method for the accurate classification and measurement of iron ore pellets is developed, overcoming the limitations of conventional algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to accurately analyze and classify pellets to identify quality issues, which cannot be satisfactorily addressed by traditional algorithms like ViT, Mask R-CNN, and anomaly segmentation algorithms.

Method: The paper develops an image-based measurement method using the StarDist algorithm, focusing on segmenting, contouring, classifying, and measuring iron ore pellets in densely packed environments.

Result: The outcome is a new method for detecting objects with smoothed boundaries that enhances the precision of physical dimension measurements and size distribution analysis.

Conclusion: The research offers a robust solution for the classification and measurement of iron ore pellets, making use of the StarDist algorithm to improve on the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification
and measurement.

Motivation: 作者希望通过改进图像分割技术，特别是在提高模型效率方面，以适应实时交互式应用的需求。与以往通过减小模型尺寸来提高效率的方法不同，本文提出了新的方法来降低分割过程中的计算量。

Method: 本文提出的方法是，给定一个图像和一个点提示，通过对提示中心进行裁剪，并运用一种新的变分辨率块标记化技术，其中远离提示点的块进行更多的降采样，从而减少了图像标记的数量。

Result: 相较于先前的工作，Segment This Thing模型在不减少模型尺寸的同时减少了分割计算成本，并且在分割基准上仍具有竞争力。它可以在普通的硬件设备上达到互动帧率。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新方法Segment This Thing模型，在提高图像分割效率的同时，保持了良好的性能，并且能够实时运行，具备在增强现实或机器人领域应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

}

Conclusion: High accuracy in pain detection is possible but comes at the cost of fairness, as exhibited by gender biases in models. This highlights the need for fairness-aware techniques in healthcare AI systems.

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

Result: 我们的实验表明，训练时采用CLoss在拓扑感知度量上提高了性能，并且修复了比其他最先进的方法多出44%的遗漏连接。

Conclusion: 我们建议的新方法在三个公开数据集和自己的三维纳米成像数据集中进行了基准测试，显示出显著的改进效果。我们已经将代码公开。

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

JAFAR is a novel, lightweight feature upsampler that aligns spatial features to produce high-resolution outputs, outperforming current methods in dense vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The necessity of upsampling low-resolution spatial features from vision encoders to high-resolution modalities for downstream tasks motivated the development of JAFAR.

Method: JAFAR utilizes an attention-based mechanism that aligns high-resolution image feature queries with semantically enriched low-resolution keys through Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) modulation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that JAFAR can recover fine-grained spatial details and perform well even at higher output scales without high-resolution supervision.

Conclusion: JAFAR, a proposed lightweight and flexible feature upsampler, effectively enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from Foundation Vision Encoders and outperforms existing methods across various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense
vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate
feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer

Main category: cs.CV

本文提出了一种新的框架来解决半监督语义分割中存在的使用未标记数据的局限性，通过使用模糊伪标签、不确定性感知的权重调整、类别再平衡以及轻量级对比正则化，有效地提升了未被充分表现类别的分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半监督语义分割方法在利用未标记数据方面存在局限性，主要表现为对伪标签的有效利用不足、类别不平衡的偏差加剧以及忽视了预测中的不确定性问题。因此，研究提出了一种新的框架以应对这些问题。

Method: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS)面临的持续挑战是如何有效地利用未标记的数据，例如无效地使用伪标签、加剧类别不平衡偏差和忽视预测不确定性。当前的方法通常通过严格的阈值来丢弃不确定区域，这会偏向于主要类别。为了克服这些限制，本文提出了一种整体框架，通过四个主要组件将不确定性转化为学习资产：(1) 模糊伪标记，保留来自top-K预测的软类别分布以丰富监督；(2) 不确定性感知动态加权，根据基于熵的可靠性分数调节像素贡献；(3) 适应性类别再平衡，动态调整损失以对抗长尾类别分布；(4) 轻量级对比正则化，鼓励紧凑的判别特征嵌入。

Result: 通过在基准数据集上的广泛的实验，展示了该方法超过了现有的最先进技术，尤其在未充分表现类别的分割和模棱两可区域的分割上取得了显著的改进。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了一个综合框架的应用可以将不确定性转化为学习优势，通过模糊伪标签、像素贡献调整、类别平衡调整和特征嵌入调节，提高了半监督语义分割的效果，特别是在对未充分表述类别和模棱两可区域的分割表现上。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class

Abstract: This paper presents a two-year research project focused on developing
AI-driven measures to analyze classroom dynamics, with particular emphasis on
teacher actions captured through multimodal sensor data. We applied real-time
data from classroom sensors and AI techniques to extract meaningful insights
and support teacher development. Key outcomes include a curated audio-visual
dataset, novel behavioral measures, and a proof-of-concept teaching review
dashboard. An initial evaluation with eight researchers from the National
Institute for Education (NIE) highlighted the system's clarity, usability, and
its non-judgmental, automated analysis approach -- which reduces manual

does not assign performance ratings, it provides an objective snapshot of
in-class interactions, helping teachers recognize and improve their
instructional strategies. Designed and tested in an Asian educational context,
this work also contributes a culturally grounded methodology to the growing
field of AI-based educational analytics.

*Chao Liang,Jianwen Jiang,Wang Liao,Jiaqi Yang,Zerong zheng,Weihong Zeng,Han Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

本文介绍了一个名为AlignHuman的框架，它通过结合偏好优化和分而治之的策略，改善了用扩散模型生成高质量且自然的人类动画的性能，提升了速度的同时保持了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于在生成和动画人类视频的任务中，动作自然性和图像保真度之间的权衡带来的挑战，使得生成表达丰富且真实的人类动画仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 本文提出了一个名为AlignHuman的框架，该框架结合了偏好优化和分而治之的训练策略来平衡动作自然性和图像保真度之间的矛盾。作者发现，在去噪过程中，早期的去噪步主要是影响动作的动态性，而保真度和人体结构则在后期去噪中得到更好的处理。基于这一观察，提出了时间步段偏好优化（TPO），并引入了两个专门的LoRAs作为专家对齐模块，分别在各自的时间段内处理特定的维度。

Result: 实验结果显示，AlignHuman提升了强基准线的表现并减少了推理中的NFEs，实现了3.3倍的加速（从100个NFEs减少到30个NFEs），同时对生成质量几乎没有影响。

Conclusion: 通过本文提出的方法，实现了动作自然性与图像保真度之间的有效平衡，为相关任务的发展提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) holds significant potential for
clinical decision support, yet existing efforts primarily focus on 2D imaging
with limited task diversity. This paper presents 3D-RAD, a large-scale dataset
designed to advance 3D Med-VQA using radiology CT scans. The 3D-RAD dataset

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific

该研究提出了CURSOR框架，一种能够在没有已标记数据的情况下恢复未知思维目标的方法，并验证了其在预测图像相似性评分，排序刺激，以及生成新刺激方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，从脑电（EEG）和图像数据中恢复思维目标的问题已经用有标签的数据进行了研究，但尚未探索无标签数据的自我校准方法。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为CURSOR的框架和算法，该算法能够在没有标签数据或预训练解码器的情况下学习恢复未知的思维目标。

Result: 实验表明，CURSOR可以在不使用任何标签信息的情况下预测图像相似性评分，使用这些评分对刺激进行排序，并生成与未知思维目标无法区分的新刺激。

Conclusion: CURSOR能够预测与人类感知判断相关的图像相似性评分，使用这些评分对刺激进行排序，并生成与未知思维目标无法区分的新刺激。这些结论通过一项用户研究(N=53)得到验证。

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a
face) that a participant has in mind from paired EEG (i.e., brain responses)
and image (i.e., perceived faces) data collected during interactive sessions
without access to labeled information. The problem has been previously explored
with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is
unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR,
that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

Motivation: 解决现有的视频字幕基准测试和评估协议中存在的问题，如关键点创建不足或同质化、成本高和评估范围有限。

Method: 使用Monte Carlo树搜索(MCTS)构建自动框架AutoCaption，以生成多样化的描述性句子，涵盖视频的详细内容，从而迭代提升视频理解能力。

Result: 评估了超过20个开源和闭源的MLLMs，Gemini-1.5-Pro在MCTS-VCB基准测试中取得了最高的F1分数71.2。此外，基于AutoCaption生成的数据微调InternVL2.5-8B，在MCTS-VCB上的整体表现提升了25.0%，在DREAM-1K上提升了16.3%。

Conclusion: AutoCaption能够有效生成多样的描述性句子，覆盖视频细节，提供了一个新的视频字幕基准测试MCTS-VCB，能够全面评估MLLMs的视频字幕生成能力。

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and
data are available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/MCTS-VCB.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在文本领域取得了显著进步，但它们忽略了一个重要方面，即非言语线索在理解社会情景中的作用。VLM虽然有可能弥补这一不足，但其在正确推理社会线索方面的能力尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 我们提出一个针对视觉语言模型的新任务：视觉社会语用推理。我们构建了一个高质量的数据集来测试VLM在这种任务中的能力，并对几种VLM的性能进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: 通过提出一个新任务和构建数据集，我们为评估VLM在视觉社会语用推理方面的能力提供了基线，揭示了其在理解和推理复杂社会情景中的潜力与不足。

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

The paper compares BiLSTM and CNN+GRU models for Human Activity Recognition using WiFi CSI datasets, finding CNN+GRU better for spatial feature extraction on UT-HAR and BiLSTM superior for long-term temporal dependencies on NTU-Fi HAR. It underscores the importance of dataset features and preprocessing for model performance and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to analyze which deep learning model, BiLSTM or CNN+GRU, performs better for human activity recognition using WiFi-based CSI datasets, to understand the impacts of different model architectures on accuracy under various dataset conditions.

Method: The method involves training and evaluating BiLSTM and CNN+GRU models on two different WiFi-based CSI datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR, and comparing their performance in terms of accuracy and their capability in extracting spatial and temporal features.

Result: The results show that the CNN+GRU model performs better on the UT-HAR dataset with an accuracy of 95.20%, while the BiLSTM model exceeds on the NTU-Fi HAR dataset with an accuracy of 92.05%. The performance is attributed to the CNN+GRU's advantage in extracting spatial features and BiLSTM's effectiveness in capturing long-term temporal dependencies.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the efficacy of deep learning models for Human Activity Recognition significantly depends on the dataset characteristics and the preprocessing techniques. The study also highlights the potential of these models for real-world applications, such as in healthcare and intelligent home systems, for unobtrusive activity recognition.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning
models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State
Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model
performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings
strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and
preprocessing techniques in model performance improvement. We also show the
real-world applicability of such models in applications like healthcare and
intelligent home systems, highlighting their potential for unobtrusive activity

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在许多任务中表现出色，但它们在医学图像视觉问答特别是推理性诊断中的应用仍然很少。此外，由于数据有限和高注释成本，监督微调对于推理任务来说在很大程度上是不切实际的。

Method: 本研究提出了一种零样本框架，通过测试时缩放策略，增强LLMs在临床环境下的推理能力。给定一张医学图像和一个文本提示，视觉-语言模型会处理图像和相应的文本提示，生成多个对视觉特征的描述或解释。然后这些解释被输入到LLM中，使用测试时缩放策略将多个候选输出整合成一个可靠的最终诊断。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，所提出的零样本框架，通过在测试时应用缩放策略，能够提升LLMs生成诊断的可靠性，并提高分类准确性。

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt

diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督域适应研究主要基于自然图像或清晰的无人机图像，而对不良条件下无人机图像的研究还处于初级阶段。这些方法在特征对齐上准确性不高，且容易受到有限或噪声伪标签的影响。本文旨在解决无人机在不利环境下的目标检测问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为统计反馈驱动阈值和掩码调整师生框架（SF-TMAT）的方法，以解决无人机在不利环境下的目标检测问题。具体来说，SF-TMAT引入了动态步骤反馈掩码调整自编码器（DSFMA）的设计，该设计动态调整掩码比例，并通过集成训练进度和损失反馈来重构特征图。此外，提出了方差反馈平滑阈值（VFST）策略，该策略从统计上计算各类别的平均置信度并通过纳入方差惩罚项来动态调整选择阈值，从而提高伪标签的质量并减轻领域偏差。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，SF-TMAT框架在不利环境下的无人机目标检测中表现出了优越性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 实验研究表明，提出的SF-TMAT在无人机不利环境下的目标检测中表现出了优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

本文提出了一种基于细调YOLOv11模型的车辆速度检测方法，能够准确识别车道并区分轻型车辆和重型车辆，解决了加州车辆数量增加所带来的交通管理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于加州车辆数量增加，交通系统不完善且测速摄像头稀少，导致有效车辆速度检测的需求增加。现有工作在车辆速度检测方面存在准确度低、无法识别车道等问题。

Method: 本文采用细调过的YOLOv11模型，使用近800张鸟瞰图图像进行训练，以提高车辆速度检测的准确性。模型能识别每辆车所在的车道并将车辆分为轻型和重型两类。

Result: 使用诺斯加州无人机拍摄的视频进行评估，细调后的YOLOv11模型取得了最佳性能，平均绝对误差（MAE）为0.97 mph，平均平方误差（MSE）为0.94 mph²。

Conclusion: 此系统展示了在车辆速度检测和分类挑战中的有效性，对于交通监控和管理具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints
are made available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tera-AI/STRIDE.
