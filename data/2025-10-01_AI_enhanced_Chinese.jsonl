While self-supervised techniques such\nas self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,\ntheir application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)\nremains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel\nframework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception\ncapabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle\nof self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates\npseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs\nto establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then\nformulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution\nthrough group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging\nits own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual\ncapability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's\nzero-shot performance by 31.8\\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.\nRemarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves\nperformance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art\nsupervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoQuality, a self-supervised framework, autonomously refines a VLM's image quality assessment capabilities, surpassing some supervised models.", "motivation": "To address the reliance on costly human-annotated data in enhancing VLMs with IQA capabilities, by applying a novel self-supervised approach named EvoQuality.", "method": "EvoQuality is a novel framework that enables a vision-language model (VLM) to autonomously refine its quality perception through self-supervised learning, using pseudo-labels generated from pairwise majority voting on the VLM's outputs.", "result": "Experiments demonstrate a significant 31.8% boost in zero-shot performance on PLCC across diverse image quality assessment (IQA) benchmarks, with EvoQuality outperforming state-of-the-art supervised models on 5 out of 7 IQA benchmarks.", "conclusion": "EvoQuality effectively improves a VLM’s quality perception without relying on human-annotated data, achieving competitive performance with supervised models."}}

To address these\nlimitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that\nadaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task\nrequirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an\nexecutor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals\ndefined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on\nintermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the\nexecutor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with\ncontext-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded\nreasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including\nsocial reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code\ngeneration.
